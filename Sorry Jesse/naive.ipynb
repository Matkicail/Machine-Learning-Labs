    "Now we need to take a sentence and calculate its most likely category, something is wrong here, definitely check to see what it is however feel free to check to see if the rest is working if you think I might have made a mistake. I tried to do a laplacian smoothing here where i checked to see if the word was contained in all before seen words and then to add an instance to each. It might be easier in this scenario to do a 'on the fly' check of each word, its index, number of times it occurs (since the list zip is in order) then we can always readily update however this will lead to slower computation speeds since we will be calculating that probability always. It might be easier for us though. Do what you feel would be easier or faster to complete the lab."
