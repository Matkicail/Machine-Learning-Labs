owl post harry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year for another he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret in the dead of night and he also happened to be a wizard it was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leatherbound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow harry moved the tip of his eaglefeather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless  discuss the quill paused at the top of a likelylooking paragraph harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and read 
nonmagic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing it on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguises harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to write pausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom hed probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer the dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harrys only living relatives they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic harrys dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible they would be able to squash the magic out of him to their fury they had been unsuccessful these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the most they could do however was to lock away harrys spellbooks wand cauldron and 
broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbors this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work one of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harrys least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernons new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom as long as he didnt leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because hed received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation ron weasley who was one of harrys best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didnt but had never used a telephone before most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the call vernon dursley speaking harry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard rons voice answer 
hello? hello? can you hear me? i  want  to  talk  to  harry  potter ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm who is this? he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece who are you? ron  weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field im  a  friend  of  harrys  from  school   uncle vernons small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spot there is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arms length as though frightened it might explode i dont know what school youre talking about never contact me again dont you come near my family and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever how dare you give this number to people like  people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spit ron obviously realized that hed gotten harry into trouble because he hadnt called again harrys other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadnt been in touch either harry suspected that ron had 
warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harrys year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one there was just one very small improvement  after swearing that he wouldnt use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley it must be very late harry thought his eyes were itching with tiredness perhaps hed finish this essay tomorrow night  he replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table it was one oclock in the morning harrys stomach gave a funny jolt he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole hour yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays he had never received a birthday card in his life the dursleys had 
completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one harry walked across the dark room past hedwigs large empty cage to the open window he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets hedwig had been absent for two nights now harry wasnt worried about her shed been gone this long before but he hoped shed be back soon  she was the only living creature in this house who didnt flinch at the sight of him harry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year his jetblack hair however was just as it always had been  stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightning of all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harrys parents because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord voldemort harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemorts curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator barely alive voldemort had fled  but harry had come facetoface with him at hogwarts remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday 
he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praise gazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeing silhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harrys direction he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it was leapt aside through the window soared three owls two of them holding up the third which appeared to be unconscious they landed with a soft flump on harrys bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless there was a large package tied to its legs harry recognized the unconscious owl at once  his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family harry dashed to the bed untied the cords around errols legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwigs cage errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some water harry turned back to the remaining owls one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errol 
harry didnt recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third package it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the night harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errols package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelope two pieces of paper fell out  a letter and a newspaper clipping the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the blackandwhite picture were moving harry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read ministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon draw a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank  the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attend 
harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid plump little mrs weasley; tall balding mr weasley; six sons; and one daughter all though the blackandwhite picture didnt show it with flamingred hair right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginny harry couldnt think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor he picked up rons letter and unfolded it dear harry happy birthday look im really sorry about that telephone call i hope the muggles didnt give you a hard time i asked dad and he reckons i shouldnt have shouted its amazing here in egypt bills taken us around all the tombs and you wouldnt believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them mum wouldnt let ginny come in the last one there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles whod broken in and grown extra heads and stuff i couldnt believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw seven hundred galleons most of its gone on this trip but theyre going to buy me a new wand for next year harry remembered only too well the occasion when rons old wand had snapped it had happened when 
the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds well be back about a week before term starts and well be going up to london to get my wand and our new books any chance of meeting you there? dont let the muggles get you down try and come to london ron ps percys head boy he got the letter last week harry glanced back at the photograph percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his hornrimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top there was another note from ron beneath it harry  this is a pocket sneakoscope if theres someone untrustworthy around its supposed to light up and spin bill says its rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isnt reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night but he didnt realize fred and george had put beetles in his soup bye  ron 
harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had brought inside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letter this time from hermione dear harry ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon i do hope youre all right im on holiday in france at the moment and i didnt know how i was going to send this to you  what if theyd opened it at customs?  but then hedwig turned up i think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change i bought your present by owlorder; there was an advertisement in the daily prophet ive been getting it delivered; its so good to keep up with whats going on in the wizarding world did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago? i bet hes learning loads im really jealous  the ancient egyptian wizards were fascinating theres some interesting local history of witchcraft here too ive rewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the things ive found out i hope its not too long  its two rolls of parchment more than professor binns asked for ron says hes going to be in london in the last week of the holidays can you make it? will your aunt and uncle let you come? i really hope you can if not ill see you on the hogwarts express on september first love from 
hermione ps ron says percys head boy ill bet percys really pleased ron doesnt seem too happy about it harry laughed as he put hermione s letter aside and picked up her present it was very heavy knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells  but it wasnt his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kit wow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look inside there was a large jar of fleetwoods highfinish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tailtwig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of doityourself broomcare apart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world  highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks harry happened to be a very good quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams one of harrys most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery 
but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly  as though it had jaws harry froze he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didnt have a normal persons view of what was dangerous hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious threeheaded dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin harry poked the parcel nervously it snapped loudly again harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled and out fell  a book harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab uhoh harry muttered the book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room harry followed it stealthily the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it ouch the book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers harry scrambled around threw himself forward and 
managed to flatten it uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next door hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrids card dear harry happy birthday think you might find this useful for next year wont say no more here tell you when i see you hope the muggles are treating you right all the best hagrid it struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrids card up next to rons and hermiones grinning more broadly than ever now there was only the letter from hogwarts left noticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first page of parchment within and read dear mr potter please note that the new school year will begin on september the first the hogwarts express will leave 
from kings cross station platform nine and three quarters at eleven oclock third years are permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade on certain weekends please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign a list of books for next year is enclosed yours sincerely professor m mcgonagall deputy headmistress harry pulled out the hogsmeade permission form and looked at it no longer grinning it would be wonderful to visit hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village and he had never set foot there but how on earth was he going to persuade uncle vernon or aunt petunia to sign the form? he looked over at the alarm clock it was now two oclock in the morning deciding that hed worry about the hogsmeade form when he woke up harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart hed made for himself counting down the days left until his return to hogwarts then he took off his glasses and lay down eyes open facing his three birthday cards extremely unusual though he was at that moment harry potter felt just like everyone else  glad for the first time in his life that it was his birthday 
aunt marges big mistake harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a brandnew television a welcomehomeforthesummer present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately no need to tell us hes no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted elbowlength tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed the reporter had reappeared the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today   hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you didnt tell us where that maniacs escaped from what use is that? lunatic could be coming up the street right now aunt petunia who was bony and horsefaced whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring lawabiding neighbors when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that hangings the only way to deal with these people? 
very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next doors runner beans uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added id better be off in a minute petunia marges train gets in at ten harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump aunt marge? he blurted out sh  shes not coming here is she? aunt marge was uncle vernons sister even though she was not a blood relative of harrys whose mother had been aunt petunias sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she didnt often stay at privet drive because she couldnt bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in harrys mind at dudleys fifth birthday party aunt marge had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to dudleys eyes margell be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while were on the subject  he pointed a fat 
finger threateningly at harry  we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was dudleys favorite form of entertainment firstly growled uncle vernon youll keep a civil tongue in your head when youre talking to marge all right said harry bitterly if she does when shes talking to me secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard harrys reply as marge doesnt know anything about your abnormality i dont want any  any funny stuff while shes here you behave yourself got me? i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face weve told marge you attend st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys what? harry yelled and youll be sticking to that story boy or therell be trouble spat uncle vernon harry sat there whitefaced and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit  it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle vernons old socks 
well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet 111 be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders? no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry duddys got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing dudleys thick blond hair mummys bought him a lovely new bow tie uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat im not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously third years at hog  at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry so? snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush and why should i do that? sneered uncle vernon well said harry choosing his words carefully itll be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits   st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle vernons voice exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle vernons large purple face its a lot to remember ill have to make it sound convincing wont i? what if i accidentally let something slip?  youll get the stuffing knocked out of you wont you? roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground knocking the stuffing out of me wont make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where im supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug  like im normal and everything harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during marges visit if at the end of it youve toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out harry didnt return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle hed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to hedwigs cage errol seemed to have recovered; he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake hedwig he said gloomily youre going to have to clear off for a week go with errol ronll look after you ill write him a note explaining and dont look at me like that  hedwigs large amber eyes were reproachful  its not my fault its the only way ill be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe but harry didnt have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall harry couldnt see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle vernons car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and purplefaced she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and eviltempered bulldog wheres my dudders? roared aunt marge wheres my neffypoo? dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into harrys stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight onearmed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt marges hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp twentypound note clutched in his fat fist 
petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a hat stand aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door tea marge? he said and what will ripper take? ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry wasnt complaining; any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals whos looking after the other dogs marge? uncle vernon asked oh ive got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge hes retired now good for him to have something to do but i couldnt leave poor old ripper he pines if hes away from me ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt marges attention to harry for the first time so she barked still here are you? yes said harry 
dont you say ‘yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled its damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you wouldnt have done it myself youd have gone straight to an orphanage if youd been dumped on my doorstep harry was bursting to say that hed rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile dont you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you havent improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon? st brutuss said uncle vernon promptly its a firstrate institution for hopeless cases i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st brutuss boy? she barked across the table er   uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt marges back yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time excellent said aunt marge i wont have this nambypamby wishywashy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is whats needed in ninetynine cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often? oh yeah said harry loads of times 
aunt marge narrowed her eyes i still dont like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly arent hitting you hard enough petunia id write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boys case perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain; in any case he changed the subject abruptly heard the news this morning marge? what about that escaped prisoner eh? as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he hadnt got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person you mustnt blame yourself for the way the boys turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if theres something rotten on the inside theres nothing anyone can do about it harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade dont say anything dont rise  
aunt marge reached for her glass of wine its one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if theres something wrong with the bitch therell be something wrong with the pup   at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right? not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel fubsters the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip  but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided hed better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since hed lost control and made something explode he couldnt afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form wasnt the only thing at stake  if he carried on like that hed be in trouble with the ministry of magic harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record wasnt exactly clean either only last summer hed gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of doityourself broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal at last at long last the final evening of marges stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of harrys faults; during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them all with a long talk about grunnings his drillmaking company; then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy can i tempt you marge? aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than that  and a bit more  thats the ticket dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle vernons angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia its normally just a fryup for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after  she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach

he  didnt work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a no account goodfornothing lazy scrounger who   he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt marges glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on   no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on harrys go on boy go on proud of your parents are you? they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect   they didnt die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little   but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger  but the swelling didnt stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech  next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls  she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her 
tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami  marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt marges whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly nooooooo uncle vernon seized one of marges feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle vernons leg harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized hedwigs empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door im going harry said ive had enough and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him hedwigs cage under his arm 
3 the knight bus harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives werent swooping down on him where he sat harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent what was going to happen to him? would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? he thought of ron and 
hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them he didnt have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london hed never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless  he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic couldnt hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father  what if he bewitched the trunk to make it featherlight tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london? then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and  begin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he couldnt sit on this wall forever or hed find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak  but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand 
he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then hed know whether it was just a stray cat or  something else lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the pebbledashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter  there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light  with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a tripledecker violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your 
wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve   the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples what were you doin down there? said stan dropping his professional manner fell over said harry  choo fall over for? sniggered stan i didnt do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight buss headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty  choo lookin at? said stan there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dog  but massive he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw stans eyes move to the scar on harrys forehead woss that on your ead? said stan abruptly 
nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he didnt want to make it too easy for them woss your name? stan persisted neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so  so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere? yep said stan proudly anywhere you like longs its on land cant do nuffink underwater ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha? stuck out your wand and dincha? yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london? eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an ot water bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into stans hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with hedwigs cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus there were no seats; instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the woodpaneled walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks im pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep you ave this one stan whispered shoving harrys trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was 
sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to ernies there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching harrys stunned face with great enjoyment this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern? somewhere in wales? ar said ernie how come the muggles dont hear the bus? said harry them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they? don look properly either never notice nuffink they don best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern well be in abergavenny in a minute stan passed harrys bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie didnt seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement 
but it didnt hit anything; lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak  ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way harry wouldnt have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didnt keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a sunkenfaced man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news stanley turned to the front page and chuckled sirius black he said nodding  course e was on the muggle news neville where you been? 
he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on harrys face removed the front page and handed it to harry you oughta read the papers more neville harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read black still at large sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis well really i had to dont you know said an irritable fudge black is mad hes a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime ministers assurance that he will not breathe a word of blacks true identity to anyone and lets face it  whod believe him if he did? while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive 
harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one scarylookin fing inee? said stan who had been watching harry read he murdered thirteen people? said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse? yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern? ar said ern darkly stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry black woz a big supporter of youknowoo he said what voldemort? said harry without thinking even stans pimples went white; ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus you outta your tree? yelped stan  choo say is name for? sorry said harry hastily sorry i  i forgot   forgot said stan weakly blimey my earts goin that fast so  so black was a supporter of youknowwho? harry prompted apologetically

moved abruptly from anglesey to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go finally harry was the only passenger left right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london? diagon alley said harry righto said stan  old tight then  bang they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight buss way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off  where he didnt know ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby looking pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley thanks harry said to ern he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and hedwigs cage onto the pavement well said harry  bye then but stan wasnt paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 there you are harry said a voice before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach  he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself stan leapt onto the pavement beside them what didja call neville minister? he said excitedly fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted neville? he repeated frowning this is harry potter i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern es arry potter i can see is scar yes said fudge testily well im very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now  fudge increased the pressure on harrys shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord youve got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything? beer? brandy? perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still hadnt let go of harry 
there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying harrys trunk and hedwigs cage and looking around excitedly  ow come you dint tell us oo you are eh neville? said stan beaming at harry while ernies owlish face peered interestedly over stans shoulder and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly  bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar  bye neville called stan fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after toms lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his bottlegreen suit and sat down opposite harry i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic harry already knew this of course; he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his fathers invisibility cloak at the time fudge wasnt to know that 
tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him well harry said fudge pouring out tea youve had us all in a right flap i dont mind telling you running away from your aunt and uncles house like that id started to think  but youre safe and thats what matters fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry eat harry you look dead on your feet now then  you will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowingup of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal squad were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so thats that and no harm done fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who couldnt believe his ears opened his mouth to speak couldnt think of anything to say and closed it again ah youre worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle? said fudge well i wont deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays harry unstuck his throat 
i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i dont ever want to go back to privet drive now now im sure youll feel differently once youve calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and im sure you are fond of each other  er  very deep down it didnt occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where youre going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and   hang on blurted harry what about my punishment? fudge blinked punishment? i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry oh my dear boy were not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we dont send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts but this didnt tally at all with harrys past dealings with the ministry of magic last year i got an official warning just because a houseelf smashed a pudding in my uncles house 
he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said id be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there unless harrys eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward circumstances change harry  we have to take into account  in the present climate    surely you dont want to be expelled? of course i dont said harry well then whats all the fuss about? laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if toms got a room for you fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what hed done? and now harry came to think of it surely it wasnt usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic? fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper room elevens free harry said fudge i think youll be very comfortable just one thing and im sure youll understand  i dont want you wandering off into muggle london all right? keep to diagon alley and youre to be back here before dark each night sure youll understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me okay said harry slowly but why  ? 
dont want to lose you again do we? said fudge with a hearty laugh no no  best we know where you are  i mean  fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak well ill be off plenty to do you know  have you had any luck with black yet? harry asked fudges finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak whats that? oh youve heard  well no not yet but its only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failed  and they are angrier than ive ever seen them fudge shuddered slightly so ill say goodbye he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea er  minister? can i ask you something? certainly said fudge with a smile well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle didnt sign the permission form dyou think you could  ? fudge was looking uncomfortable ah he said no no im very sorry harry but as im not your parent or guardian   
but youre the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission   no im sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly perhaps youll be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think its best if you dont  yes  well ill be off enjoy your stay harry and with a last smile and shake of harrys hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry if youll follow me mr potter he said ive already taken your things up  harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him inside was a very comfortablelooking bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe  hedwig harry gasped the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto harrys arm very smart owl youve got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if theres anything you need mr potter dont hesitate to ask he gave another bow and left harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that hed left privet drive 
only a few hours ago that he wasnt expelled and that he was now facing three dursleyfree weeks its been a very weird night hedwig he yawned and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
the leaky cauldron it took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a days shopping; venerablelooking wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today; wildlooking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall 
harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases its a lunascope old boy  no more messing around with moon charts see? or else discussing the case of sirius black personally i wont let any of the children out alone until hes back in azkaban harry didnt have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an hour once harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of self control not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a nastysmelling liquid into the other players face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested harrys resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after hed arrived at the leaky cauldron curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was 
mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life just come out  prototype   a squarejawed wizard was telling his companion its the fastest broom in the world isnt it dad? squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his fathers arm irish international sides just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and theyre favorites for the world cup a large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broom the firebolt this stateoftheart racing broom sports a stream lined superfine handle of ash treated with a diamondhard polish and handnumbered with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision the firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on request price on request  harry didnt like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life  but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nimbus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already? harry didnt ask for the price 
but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the firebolt there were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam malkins robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of gold embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved; he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet as harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward him hogwarts? he said abruptly come to get your new books? yes said harry i need   
get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cage hang on said harry quickly ive already got one of those have you? a look of enormous relief spread over the managers face thank heavens for that ive been bitten five times already this morning   a loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apart stop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart im never stocking them again never its been bedlam i thought wed seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the invisible book of invisibility  cost a fortune and we never found them  well  is there anything else i can help you with? yes said harry looking down his booklist i need unfogging the future by cassandra vablatsky ah starting divination are you? said the manager stripping off his gloves and leading harry into the back of the shop where there was a corner devoted to fortunetelling a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foul here you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick blackbound book unfogging the future very good guide to all your 
basic fortunetelling methods  palmistry crystal balls bird entrails   but harry wasnt listening his eyes had fallen on another book which was among a display on a small table death omens what to do when you know the worst is coming oh i wouldnt read that if i were you said the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at youll start seeing death omens everywhere its enough to frighten anyone to death but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiar  the manager pressed unfogging the future into harrys hands anything else? he said yes said harry tearing his eyes away from the dogs and dazedly consulting his booklist er  i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade three harry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people he tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin 
it cant have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescent  it was probably just a stray dog  he raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat youre fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a wheezy voice as the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt; he also ran into the real neville longbottom a roundfaced forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry didnt stop to chat; neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidablelooking grandmother harry hoped she never found out that hed pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magic harry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where hed have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turned harry harry they were there both of them sitting outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor  ron looking incredibly freckly hermione very brown both waving frantically at him 
finally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said youd left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam malkins and   i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew im staying at the leaky cauldron? dad said ron simply mr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge did you really blow up your aunt harry? said hermione in a very serious voice i didnt mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just  lost control its not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly im amazed harry wasnt expelled so am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad doesnt know why fudge let me off does he? probably cause its you isnt it? shrugged ron still chuckling famous harry potter and all that id hate to see what the ministryd do to me if i blew up an aunt mind you theyd have to dig me up first because mum wouldve killed me anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening were staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you can come to kings cross with us tomorrow hermiones there as well 
hermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts things excellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stuff? look at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it brandnew wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn tailhair and weve got all our books   he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh? the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two whats all that hermione? harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her well im taking more new subjects than you arent i? said hermione those are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination study of ancient runes muggle studies   what are you doing muggle studies for? said ron rolling his eyes at harry youre muggleborn your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about muggles but itll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestly are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione? asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them ive still got ten galleons she said checking her purse its my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present 
how about a nice book? said ron innocently no i dont think so said hermione composedly i really want an owl i mean harrys got hedwig and youve got errol   i havent said ron errols a family owl all ive got is scabbers he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i dont think egypt agreed with him scabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskers theres a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if theyve got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owl so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menagerie there wasnt much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cages it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of doubleended newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cages a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a jewelencrusted shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny 
custardcolored furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tails the doubleended newt wizard left and ron approached the counter its my rat he told the witch he been a bit offcolor ever since i brought him back from egypt bang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look like nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to rons brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegone hm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this rat? dunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brother what powers does he have? said the witch examining scabbers closely er   the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the witchs eyes moved from scabbers s tattered left ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudly 
hes been through the mill this one she said he was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensively an ordinary common or garden rat like this cant be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more hardwearing you might like one of these   she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered showoffs well if you dont want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle okay said ron how much  ouch ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers no crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed splaylegged on the floor and then scampered for the door scabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him; harry followed it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head what was that? 
it was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harry wheres hermione? probably getting her owl   they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie as they reached it hermione came out but she wasnt carrying an owl her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat you bought that monster? said ron his mouth hanging open hes gorgeous isnt he? said hermione glowing that was a matter of opinion thought harry the cats ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in hermione s arms hermione that thing nearly scalped me said ron he didnt mean to did you crookshanks? said hermione and what about scabbers? said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation hows he going to get it with that thing around? that reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into rons hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours 
whats the problem? poor crookshanks that witch said hed been in there for ages; no one wanted him i wonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldron they found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophet harry he said smiling as he looked up how are you? fine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with all their shopping mr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at him they still havent caught him then? he asked no said mr weasley looking extremely grave theyve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so far would we get a reward if we caught him? asked ron itd be good to get some more money   dont be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained blacks not going to be caught by a thirteenyearold wizard its the azkaban guards wholl get him back you mark my words at that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts; the newly elected head boy percy; and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginny 
ginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harry how nice to see you hello percy said harry trying not to laugh i hope youre well? said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayor very well thanks   harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply simply splendid to see you old boy  marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing harrys hand in turn absolutely spiffing percy scowled thats enough now said mrs weasley mum said fred as though hed only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you   i said thats enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose youve heard our exciting news? she pointed to the brandnew silver badge on percys chest second head boy in the family she said swelling with pride 
and last fred muttered under his breath i dont doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they havent made you two prefects what do we want to be prefects for? said george looking revolted at the very idea itd take all the fun out of life ginny giggled you want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs weasley ginnys got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily im going up to change for dinner  he disappeared and george heaved a sigh we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted us dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courses howre we getting to kings cross tomorrow dad? asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding the ministrys providing a couple of cars said mr weasley everyone looked up at him why? said percy curiously 
its because of you perce said george seriously and therell be little flags on the hoods with hb on them     for humongous bighead said fred everyone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their pudding why are the ministry providing cars father? percy asked again in a dignified voice well as we havent got one anymore said mr weasley   and as i work there theyre doing me a favor   his voice was casual but harry couldnt help noticing that mr weasleys ears had gone red just like rons did when he was under pressure good thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage youve all got between you? a nice sight youd be on the muggle underground  you are all packed arent you? ron hasnt put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a longsuffering voice hes dumped them on my bed youd better go and pack properly ron because we wont have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percy after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going on 
the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting it was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing   i havent touched it all right? ron roared back whats up? said harry my head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harry sos scabberss rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i mightve left it in the bar   youre not going anywhere till youve found my badge yelled percy ill get scabberss stuff im packed harry said to ron and he went downstairs harry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very dark when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrs weasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know hed heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door  makes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedly harrys got a right to know ive tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child hes thirteen years old and   arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry 
back to school with that hanging over him? for heavens sake hes happy not knowing i dont want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard retorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves  theyve even ended up in the forbidden forest but harry mustnt do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadnt picked him up im prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him but hes not dead hes fine so whats the point   molly they say sirius blacks mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and thats supposed to be impossible its been a month and no ones seen hide nor hair of him and i dont care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet were no nearer catching black than inventing self spelling wands the only thing we know for sure is what blacks after   but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts but no ones really sure that blacks after harry   there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the table molly how many times do i have to tell you? they didnt report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the 
same words ‘hes at hogwarts  hes at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring youknowwho back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped youknowwho and hes had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that  there was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear more well arthur you must do what you think is right but youre forgetting albus dumbledore i dont think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while dumbledore s headmaster i suppose he knows about all this? of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he wasnt happy about it but he agreed not happy? why shouldnt he be happy if theyre there to catch black? dumbledore isnt fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavily nor am i if it comes to that  but when youre dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those youd rather avoid if they save harry     then i will never say another word against them said mr weasley wearily its late molly wed better go up  harry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later 
footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairs the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs weasleys bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and rons room in search of his badge weve got it fred whispered to harry weve been improving it the badge now read bigheacl boy harry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed so sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive hed made harry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the train harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didnt feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be panicstricken if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be didnt people always say 
that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid of? surely black as voldemorts righthand man would be just as frightened of him? and then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about they seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school blacks chances of getting inside seemed very remote no all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught; in fact harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed he scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he couldnt look after himself? hed escaped lord voldemort three times; he wasnt completely useless unbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is coming    im not going to be murdered harry said out loud thats the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily 
5 the dementor tom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable the sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now hes accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend shes hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy  ive got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy again they headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling 
hermione and ginny about a love potion shed made as a young girl all three of them were rather giggly what were you saying? ron asked harry as they sat down later harry muttered as percy stormed in harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky cauldrons narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes percys screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudly its all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerwork ill let you out on the train you wont snapped ron what about poor scabbers eh? he pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocket mr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuck his head inside theyre here he said harry come on mr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two oldfashioned dark green cars each of which was driven by a furtive looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet in you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded street 
harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione ron and to rons disgust percy the journey to kings cross was very uneventful compared with harrys trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle vernons new company car certainly couldnt have managed they reached kings cross with twenty minutes to spare; the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights mr weasley kept close to harrys elbow all the way into the station right then he said glancing around them lets do this in pairs as there are so many of us ill go through first with harry mr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten pushing harrys trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated him in a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and threequarters and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train 
percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run ah theres penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught harrys eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldnt miss his shiny badge once the remaining weasleys and hermione had joined them harry and ron led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty they loaded the trunks onto it stowed hedwig and crookshanks in the luggage rack then went back outside to say goodbye to mr and mrs weasley mrs weasley kissed all her children then hermione and finally harry he was embarrassed but really quite pleased when she gave him an extra hug do take care wont you harry? she said as she straightened up her eyes oddly bright then she opened her enormous handbag and said ive made you all sandwiches  here you are ron  no theyre not corned beef  fred? wheres fred? here you are dear  harry said mr weasley quietly come over here a moment he jerked his head toward a pillar and harry followed him behind it leaving the others crowded around mrs weasley theres something ive got to tell you before you leave   said mr weasley in a tense voice 
its all right mr weasley said harry i already know you know? how could you know? i  er  i heard you and mrs weasley talking last night i couldnt help hearing harry added quickly sorry   thats not the way id have chosen for you to find out said mr weasley looking anxious no  honestly its okay this way you havent broken your word to fudge and i know whats going on harry you must be very scared   im not said harry sincerely really he added because mr weasley was looking disbelieving im not trying to be a hero but seriously sirius black cant be worse than voldemort can he? mr weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it harry i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than fudge seems to think and im obviously pleased that youre not scared but   arthur called mrs weasley who was now shepherding the rest onto the train arthur what are you doing? its about to go hes coming molly said mr weasley but he turned back to harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice listen i want you to give me your word   
  that ill be a good boy and stay in the castle? said harry gloomily not entirely said mr weasley who looked more serious than harry had ever seen him harry swear to me you wont go looking for black harry stared what? there was a loud whistle guards were walking along the train slamming all the doors shut promise me harry said mr weasley talking more quickly still that whatever happens   why would i go looking for someone i know wants to kill me? said harry blankly swear to me that whatever you might hear   arthur quickly cried mrs weasley steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move harry ran to the compartment door and ron threw it open and stood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mr and mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view i need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speed go away ginny said ron oh thats nice said ginny huffily and she stalked off 
harry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train this had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cart the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizards robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with gray who dyou reckon he is? ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the window professor r j lupin whispered hermione at once how dyou know that? its on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the mans head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters wonder what he teaches? said ron frowning at professor lupins pallid profile thats obvious whispered hermione theres only one vacancy isnt there? defense against the dark arts harry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of 
whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxed well i hope hes up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like one good hex would finish him off doesnt he? anyway  he turned to harry what were you going to tell us? harry explained all about mr and mrs weasleys argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him when hed finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you? oh harry  youll have to be really really careful dont go looking for trouble harry   i dont go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me how thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him? said ron shakily they were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was no one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ones ever done it before and he was a topsecurity prisoner too but theyll catch him wont they? said hermione earnestly i mean theyve got all the muggles looking out for him too  whats that noise? said ron suddenly a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere they looked all around the compartment 
its coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between harrys robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of rons hand and glowing brilliantly is that a sneakoscope? said hermione interestedly standing up for a better look yeah  mind you its a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to errols leg to send it to harry were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time? said hermione shrewdly no well  i wasnt supposed to be using errol you know hes not really up to long journeys  but how else was i supposed to get harrys present to him? stick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or itll wake him up he nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle vernons old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on it we could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back down they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told me do you know much about hogsmeade? asked hermione keenly ive read its the only entirely non muggle settlement in britain   
yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of way but thats not why i want to go i just want to get inside honeydukes whats that? said hermione its this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his face where theyve got everything  pepper imps  they make you smoke at the mouth  and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like youre thinking what to write next   but hogsmeades a very interesting place isnt it? hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion and the shrieking shacks supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain     and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while youre sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was saying hermione looked around at harry wont it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade?  spect it will said harry heavily youll have to tell me when youve found out what dyou mean? said ron i cant go the dursleys didnt sign my permission form and fudge wouldnt either 
ron looked horrified youre not allowed to come? but  no way  mcgonagall or someone will give you permission   harry gave a hollow laugh professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house was very strict   or we can ask fred and george they know every secret passage out of the castle   ron said hermione sharply i dont think harry should be sneaking out of school with black on the loose   yeah i expect thats what mcgonagall will say when i ask for permission said harry bitterly but if were with him said ron spiritedly to hermione black wouldnt dare   oh ron dont talk rubbish snapped hermione blacks already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street do you really think hes going to worry about attacking harry just because were there? she was fumbling with the straps of crookshankss basket as she spoke dont let that thing out ron said but too late; crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket stretched yawned and sprang onto rons knees; the lump in rons pocket trembled and he shoved crookshanks angrily away get out of here ron dont said hermione angrily 
ron was about to answer back when professor lupin stirred they watched him apprehensively but he simply turned his head the other way mouth slightly open and slept on the hogwarts express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened people were chasing backward and forward past the door of their compartment crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat his squashed face turned toward ron his yellow eyes on rons top pocket at one oclock the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door dyou think we should wake him up? ron asked awkwardly nodding toward professor lupin he looks like he could do with some food hermione approached professor lupin cautiously er  professor? she said excuse me  professor? he didnt move dont worry dear said the witch as she handed harry a large stack of cauldron cakes if hes hungry when he wakes ill be up front with the driver i suppose he is asleep? said ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed i mean  he hasnt died has he? no no hes breathing whispered hermione taking the cauldron cake harry passed her he might not be very good company but professor lupins presence in their compartment had its uses 
midafternoon just as it had started to rain blurring the rolling hills outside the window they heard footsteps in the corridor again and their three least favorite people appeared at the door draco malfoy flanked by his cronies vincent crabbe and gregory goyle draco malfoy and harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first train journey to hogwarts malfoy who had a pale pointed sneering face was in slytherin house; he played seeker on the slytherin quidditch team the same position that harry played on the gryffindor team crabbe and goyle seemed to exist to do malfoys bidding they were both wide and musclely; crabbe was taller with a puddingbowl haircut and a very thick neck; goyle had short bristly hair and long gorillaish arms well look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weasel crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer weasley said malfoy did your mother die of shock? ron stood up so quickly he knocked crookshankss basket to the floor professor lupin gave a snort whos that? said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupin new teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoy? 
malfoys pale eyes narrowed; he wasnt fool enough to pick a fight right under a teachers nose cmon he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappeared harry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knuckles im not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrily i mean it if he makes one more crack about my family im going to get hold of his head and   ron made a violent gesture in midair ron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be careful  but professor lupin was still fast asleep the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks the train rattled the rain hammered the wind roared but still professor lupin slept we must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black window the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down great said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside im starving i want to get to the feast  
we cant be there yet said hermione checking her watch so whyre we stopping? the train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows harry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments the train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warning all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness whats going on? said rons voice from behind harry ouch gasped hermione ron that was my foot harry felt his way back to his seat dyou think weve broken down? dunno  there was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ron wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out theres something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboard  the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over harrys legs 
sorry  dyou know whats going on?  ouch  sorry   hullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloak harry? is that you? whats happening? no idea  sit down   there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; neville had tried to sit on crookshanks im going to go and ask the driver whats going on came hermiones voice harry felt her pass him heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain whos that? whos that? ginny? hermione? what are you doing? i was looking for ron   come in and sit down   not here said harry hurriedly im here ouch said neville quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly 
professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his corner none of them spoke there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames they illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert and wary stay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it standing in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in lupins hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood harrys eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish slimylooking and scabbed like something dead that had decayed in water    but it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed harrys gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak and then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slow rattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings an intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper 
than his skin it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart  harrys eyes rolled up into his head he couldnt see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder    and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but couldnt  a thick white fog was swirling around him inside him  harry harry are you all right? someone was slapping his face w  what? harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking  the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his face ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat are you okay? ron asked nervously yeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened? wheres that  that thing? who screamed? no one screamed said ron more nervously still 
harry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very pale but i heard screaming   a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces here he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it itll help harry took the chocolate but didnt eat it what was that thing? he asked lupin a dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone else one of the dementors of azkaban everyone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket eat he repeated itll help i need to speak to the driver excuse me  he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor are you sure youre okay harry? said hermione watching harry anxiously i dont get it  what happened? said harry wiping more sweat off his face well  that thing  the dementor  stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i couldnt see its face  and you  you   
i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching   and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementor and pulled out his wand said hermione and he said ‘none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor didnt move so lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away  it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came in? i felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like id never be cheerful again  ginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob; hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her but didnt any of you  fall off your seats? said harry awkwardly no said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad though  harry didnt understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame why had he gone to pieces like that when no one else had? professor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked around and said with a small smile i havent poisoned that chocolate you know  
harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes well be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harry? harry didnt ask how professor lupin knew his name fine he muttered embarrassed they didnt talk much during the remainder of the journey at long last the train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted cats meowed and nevilles pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets firs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the terrifiedlooking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake all righ you three? hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the door the coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in procession the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and 
hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars harry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle; hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a halt and hermione and ron got out as harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his ear you fainted potter? is longbottom telling the truth? you actually fainted? malfoy elbowed past hermione to block harrys way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously shove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clenched did you faint as well weasley? said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasley? is there a problem? said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he 
said oh no  er  professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors the door into the great hall stood open at the right; harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you both harry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagall transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong theres no need to look so worried  i just want a word in my office she told them move along there weasley ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridor once they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fire professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself 
behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potter before harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling in harry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that hed passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fuss im fine he said i dont need anything   oh its you is it? said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose youve been doing something dangerous again? it was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagall they exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly setting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back harrys hair and feeling his forehead he wont be the last one who collapses yes hes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate   im not delicate said harry crossly of course youre not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulse what does he need? said professor mcgonagall crisply bed rest? should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing? 
‘tm ine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture well he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into harrys eyes ive already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us did he now? said madam pomfrey approvingly so weve finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies? are you sure you feel all right potter? professor mcgonagall said sharply yes said harry very well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast together harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes; then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hall it was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a threelegged stool out of the hall 
oh said hermione softly weve missed the sorting new students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast? he and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seats what was all that about? he muttered to harry harry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke off professor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beard halfmoon spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that wasnt why harry respected him you couldnt help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment welcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beard welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it 
out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast  dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic business he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises  or even invisibility cloaks he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he said percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a sound on a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year first professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher 
there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes look at snape ron hissed in harrys ear professor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape wanted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry as to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacher retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties harry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was rubyred in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard 
we shouldve known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting book? harry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth well i think thats everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast begin the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat it was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid wasnt a fully qualified wizard; he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared hagrid s name last year at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chance congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers table all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe it  great man dumbledore  came straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn 
said hed had enough  its what i always wanted overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them password? coming through coming through percy called from behind the crowd the new passwords ‘fortuna major oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwords through the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five fourposter beds and harry looking around felt he was home at last 
talons and tea leaves when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him its not worth it  hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooo harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley new thirdyear course schedules said george passing them over whats up with you harry? malfoy said ron sitting down on georges other side and glaring over at the slytherin table 
george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again that little git he said calmly he wasnt so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment didnt he fred? nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy i wasnt too happy myself said george theyre horrible things those dementors  sort of freeze your insides dont they? said fred you didnt pass out though did you? said harry in a low voice forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred? and he said it was the worst place hed ever been he came back all weak and shaking    they suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there anyway well see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember? the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes hermione was examining her new schedule ooh good were starting some new subjects today she said happily 
hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder theyve messed up your schedule look  theyve got you down for about ten subjects a day there isnt enough time ill manage ive fixed it all with professor mcgonagall but look said ron laughing see this morning? nine oclock divination and underneath nine oclock muggle studies and  ron leaned closer to the schedule disbelieving   look  underneath that arithmancy nine oclock i mean i know youre good hermione but no ones that good howre you supposed to be in three classes at once? dont be silly said hermione shortly of course i wont be in three classes at once well then   pass the marmalade said hermione but   oh ron whats it to you if my schedules a bit full? hermione snapped i told you ive fixed it all with professor mcgonagall just then hagrid entered the great hall he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand all righ? he said eagerly pausing on the way to the staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after lunch bin up since five gettin everythin ready  hope its okay  me a teacher  honesly  
he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat wonder what hes been getting ready? said ron a note of anxiety in his voice the hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward their first lesson ron checked his course schedule wed better go look divinations at the top of north tower itll take us ten minutes to get there  they finished their breakfasts hastily said goodbye to fred and george and walked back through the hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of laughter followed harry into the entrance hall the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one two years at hogwarts hadnt taught them everything about the castle and they had never been inside north tower before theres  got  to  be  a  shortcut ron panted as they climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall i think its this way said hermione peering down the empty passage to the right cant be said ron thats south look you can see a bit of the lake out of the window  harry was watching the painting a fat dapplegray pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of 
hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one another but he always enjoyed watching it a moment later a short squat knight in a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees he had just fallen off aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance? draw you knaves you dogs they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass are you all right? said harry moving closer to the picture get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he couldnt get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face listen said harry taking advantage of the knights exhaustion were looking for the north tower you dont know the way do you? a quest the knights rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge 
he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some sinisterlooking monks farewell my comradesinarms if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan yeah well call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it  ‘sibyll trelawney divination teacher  harry read howre we supposed to get up there? 
as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at harrys feet everyone got quiet after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first he emerged into the strangestlooking classroom he had ever seen in fact it didnt look like a classroom at all more like a cross between someones attic and an oldfashioned tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dustylooking feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups ron appeared at harrys shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers where is she? ron said a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last harrys immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin; her 
large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach you books can take you only so far in this field  at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books wouldnt be much help in this subject many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy 
she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well? i think so said neville tremulously i wouldnt be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a redhaired man parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball  if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us forever a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot? lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading  it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october 
lavender trembled now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear  she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up  after youve broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? im rather attached to the pink sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you wouldnt mind  thank you  when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine? a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom 
harry tried to pull himself together right youve got a crooked sort of cross  he consulted unfogging the future that means youre going to have ‘trials and suffering  sorry about that  but theres a thing that could be the sun  hang on  that means ‘great happiness  so youre going to suffer but be very happy  you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction my turn  ron peered into harrys teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort theres a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe youre going to work for the ministry of magic  he turned the teacup the other way up but this way it looks more like an acorn  whats that? he scanned his copy of unfogging the future  ‘a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some  and theres a thing here he turned the cup again that looks like an animal    yeah if that was its head  it looks like a hippo  no a sheep  professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching harrys cup from him everyone went quiet to watch professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise the falcon  my dear you have a deadly enemy 
but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and youknowwho harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to harrys cup again and continued to turn it the club  an attack dear dear this is not a happy cup  i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly the skull  danger in your path my dear  everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed there was another tinkle of breaking china; neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed my dear boy    my poor dear boy  no  it is kinder not to say  no  dont ask me  what is it professor? said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and rons table pressing close to professor trelawneys chair to get a good look at harrys cup 
my dear professor trelawneys huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim the what? said harry he could tell that he wasnt the only one who didnt understand; dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry hadnt understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen  the worst omen  of death  harrys stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts  the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescent    lavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor trelawneys chair i dont think it looks like a grim she said flatly professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike youll forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left 
when youve all finished deciding whether im going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yes  please pack away your things  silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding harrys eyes until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear  she pointed at neville  youll be late next time so mind you work extrahard to catch up harry ron and hermione descended professor trelawneys ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor mcgonagalls transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and wasnt even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes really what has got into you all today? said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that 
it matters but thats the first time my transformations not got applause from a class everybodys heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand please professor weve just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and   ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year? everyone stared at her me said harry finally i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyes then you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues   professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney   she stopped again and then said in a very matterof fact tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i dont let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in 
hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor trelawneys classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about nevilles cup? when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didnt start harry he said in a low serious voice you havent seen a great black dog anywhere have you? yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys ron let his fork fall with a clatter probably a stray said hermione calmly ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad hermione if harrys seen a grim thats  thats bad he said my  my uncle bilius saw one and  and he died twentyfour hours later coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice 
you dont know what youre talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the grims not an omen its the cause of death and harrys still with us because hes not stupid enough to see one and think right well id better kick the bucket then ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly you didnt seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly professor trelawney said you didnt have the right aura you just dont like being bad at something for a change he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves im not sure ill be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class she snatched up her bag and stalked away 
ron frowned after her whats she talking about? he said to harry she hasnt been to an arithmancy class yet harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch yesterdays rain had cleared; the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class ron and hermione werent speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hagrids hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three onlytoofamiliar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start cmon now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson cornin up everyone here? right follow me for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there 
everyone gather round the fence here he called thats it  make sure yeh can see  now firs thing yehll want ter do is open yer books   how? said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy eh? said hagrid how do we open our books? malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too; some like harry had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips hasn  hasn anyone bin able ter open their books? said hagrid looking crestfallen the class all shook their heads yehve got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look  he took hermiones copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand oh how silly weve all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why didnt we guess i  i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off 
shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted hagrid s first lesson to be a success righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so  so yehve got yer books an  an  now yeh need the magical creatures yeah so ill go an get em hang on  he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my fatherll have a fit when i tell him   shut up malfoy harry repeated careful potter theres a dementor behind you   oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel steelcolored beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence 
hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them beauiful aren they? harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer   no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is theyre proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are dont never insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do malfoy crabbe and goyle werent listening; they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued its polite see? yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back yehre allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt right  who wants ter go first? most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing 
their powerful wings; they didnt seem to like being tethered like this no one? said hagrid with a pleading look ill do it said harry there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence good man harry roared hagrid right then  lets see how yeh get on with buckbeak he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath malfoys eyes were narrowed maliciously easy now harry said hagrid quietly yehve got eye contact now try not ter blink  hippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much  harrys eyes immediately began to water but he didnt shut them buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye thas it said hagrid thas it harry  now bow harry didnt feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up 
the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it didnt move ah said hagrid sounding worried right  back away now harry easy does it   but then to harrys enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right  yeh can touch him pat his beak go on feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he might let yeh ride him this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick; but he wasnt sure a hippogriff would be quite the same yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that  harry put his foot on the top of buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry wasnt sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers 
go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters without warning twelvefoot wings flapped open on either side of harry; he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriffs wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didnt dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four ill assorted feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go? emboldened by harrys success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which didnt seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched 
malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do it  i bet youre not dangerous at all are you? he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute? it happened in a flash of steely talons; malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes im dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked im dying look at me its killed me yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me  gotta get him outta here   hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on malfoys arm; blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid they should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears it was malfoys fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly 
they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall im going to see if hes okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower dyou think hell be all right? said hermione nervously  course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse that was a really bad thing to happen in hagrid s first class though wasnt it? said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him  they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he wasnt there they wouldnt fire him would they? said hermione anxiously not touching her steakandkidney pudding theyd better not said ron who wasnt eating either harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured well you cant say it wasnt an interesting first day back said ron gloomily 
they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window theres a light on in hagrids window harry said suddenly ron looked at his watch if we hurried we could go down and see him its still quite early  i dont know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him im allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black hasnt got past the dementors yet has he? so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they werent entirely sure they were supposed to be out the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hagrids hut they knocked and a voice growled cmin hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound fang had his head in hagrids lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus 
 spect its a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon theyve ever had a teacher who lasted ony a day before you havent been fired hagrid gasped hermione not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard but s only a matter o time int it after malfoy  how is he? said ron as they all sat down it wasnt serious was it? madam pomfrey fixed him best she could said hagrid dully but hes sayin its still agony  covered in bandages  moanin  hes faking it said harry at once madam pomfrey can mend anything she regrew half my bones last year trust malfoy to milk it for all its worth school govnors have bin told o course said hagrid miserably they reckon i started too big shoulda left hippogriffs fer later  done flobberworms or summat  jus thought itd make a good firs lesson  s all my fault  its all malfoy s fault hagrid said hermione earnestly were witnesses said harry you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them its malfoys problem that he wasnt listening well tell dumbledore what really happened yeah dont worry hagrid well back you up said ron 
tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of hagrid s beetleblack eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a bonebreaking hug i think youve had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it ar maybe shes right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash whats he done? said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes thas better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really   hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though hed only just realized he was there what dyeh think youre doin eh? he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air yeh re not to go wanderin around after dark harry an you two lettin him hagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door 
cmon hagrid said angrily im takinyer all back up ter school an don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again im not worth that 
7 the boggart in the wardrobe malfoy didnt reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in harrys opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle how is it draco? simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much? yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away settle down settle down said professor snape idly harry and ron scowled at each other; snape wouldnt have said settle down if theyd walked in late hed have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in snape s 
classes; snape was head of slytherin house and generally favored his own students above all others they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table sir malfoy called sir ill need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm   weasley cut up malfoys roots for him said snape without looking up ron went brick red theres nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoy malfoy smirked across the table weasley you heard professor snape; cut up these roots ron seized his knife pulled malfoys roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizes professor drawled malfoy weasleys mutilating my roots sir snape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the roots then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hair change roots with malfoy weasley but sir   
ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces now said snape in his most dangerous voice ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at malfoy then took up the knife again and sir 111 need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughter potter you can skin malfoys shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him harry took malfoys shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever seen your pal hagrid lately? he asked them quietly none of your business said ron jerkily without looking up im afraid he wont be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow fathers not very happy about my injury   keep talking malfoy and ill give you a real injury snarled ron   hes complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic fathers got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this  he gave a huge fake sigh  who knows if my armll ever be the same again? 
so thats why youre putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid fired well said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper  partly  potter but there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for me a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons; it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned  orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? didnt you hear me say quite clearly that only one rat spleen was needed? didnt i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom? neville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tears please sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right   i dont remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly snape moved away leaving neville breathless with fear 
help me he moaned to hermione hey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow harrys brass scales have you heard? daily prophet this morning  they reckon sirius blacks been sighted where? said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the table malfoy looked up listening closely not too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she didnt really understand the muggles think hes just an ordinary criminal dont they? so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone not too far from here   ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoy? need something else skinned? but malfoys eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed on harry he leaned across the table thinking of trying to catch black singlehanded potter? yeah thats right said harry offhandedly malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile of course if it was me he said quietly id have done something before now i wouldnt be staying in school like a good boy id be out there looking for him what are you talking about malfoy? said ron roughly 
dont you know potter? breathed malfoy his pale eyes narrowed know what? malfoy let out a low sneering laugh maybe youd rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you? but if it was me id want revenge id hunt him down myself  what are you talking about? said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then well test longbottoms  crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape wouldnt see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner what did malfoy mean? harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyles mouth why would i want revenge on black? he hasnt done anything to me  yet hes making it up said ron savagely hes trying to make you do something stupid  the end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldron everyone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to longbottoms toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking 
solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i dont doubt he has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisoned the gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into nevilles potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down trevors throat there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped; then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in snape s palm the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why didnt you lie hermione? you shouldve said neville did it all by himself hermione didnt answer ron looked around where is she? harry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunch 
she was right behind us said ron frowning malfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappeared there she is said harry hermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes how did you do that? said ron what? said hermione joining them one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again what? hermione looked slightly confused oh  i had to go back for something oh no   a seam had split on hermiones bag harry wasnt surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books why are you carrying all these around with you? ron asked her you know how many subjects im taking said hermione breathlessly couldnt hold these for me could you? but   ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you havent got any of these subjects today its only defense against the dark arts this afternoon 
oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope theres something good for lunch im starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall dyou get the feeling hermione s not telling us something? ron asked harry professor lupin wasnt there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teachers desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags todays will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if youd follow me puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum 
peeves didnt look up until professor lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curlytoed feet and broke into song loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin   rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise he was still smiling id take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch wont be able to get in to his brooms filch was the hogwarts caretaker a badtempered failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor lupins words except to blow a loud wet raspberry professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely he raised the wand to shoulder height said  waddiwasil  and pointed it at peeves with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down peeves s left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing cool sir said dean thomas in amazement 
thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed? they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin td rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no ones warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear neville went scarlet harry glared at snape; it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers professor lupin had raised his eyebrows i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably 
nevilles face went if possible even redder snapes lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm theres a boggart in there most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks  ive even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart? hermione put up her hand its a shapeshifter she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most couldnt have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on 
the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore nevilles small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry? trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very offputting but harry had a go er  because there are so many of us it wont know what shape it should be? precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed its always best to have company when youre dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a flesheating slug? i once saw a boggart make that very mistake  tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing we will practice the charm without wands first after me please  riddikulusv  riddikulusv said the class together good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part im afraid you see the word alone 
is not enough and this is where you come in neville the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world? nevilles lips moved but no noise came out didnt catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful professor snape  hmmm  neville i believe you live with your grandmother? er  yes said neville nervously but  i dont want the boggart to turn into her either no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears? neville looked startled but said well  always the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dress  green normally  and sometimes a foxfur scarf 
and a handbag? prompted professor lupin a big red one said neville right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville? can you see them in your minds eye? yes said neville uncertainly plainly wondering what was coming next when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand  thus  and cry ‘riddikulus  and concentrate hard on your grandmothers clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that vulturetopped hat and that green dress with that big red handbag there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical  the room went quiet harry thought  what scared him most in the world? his first thought was lord voldemort  a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart  voldemort a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind  
a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloak  a long rattling breath from an unseen mouth    then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning  harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about rons greatest fear was spiders everyone ready? said professor lupin harry felt a lurch of fear he wasnt ready how could you make a dementor less frightening? but he didnt want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves neville were going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right? ill call the next person forward  everyone back now so neville can get a clear shot   they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one  two  three  now a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor lupins wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open hooknosed and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville 
neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes r  r  riddikulusv squeaked neville there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled; he was wearing a long lacetrimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a motheaten vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag there was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising  riddikulusv cried parvati a bandage unraveled at the mummys feet; it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off seamus roared professor lupin seamus darted past parvati crack  where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal green tinged face  a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on harrys head stand on end  riddikulusv shouted seamus 
the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then  crack  became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before  crack   becoming a single bloody eyeball its confused shouted lupin were getting there dean dean hurried forward crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab riddikulusv yelled dean there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap excellent ron you next ron leapt forward crack quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then  riddikulusv bellowed ron and the spiders legs vanished; it rolled over and over; lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at harrys feet he raised his wand ready but  
here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a silverywhite orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulusv almost lazily crack  forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined riddikulusv he shouted and they had a split seconds view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyone  let me see  five points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart  ten for neville because he did it twice    and five each to hermione and harry but i didnt do anything said harry you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me  to be handed in on monday that will be all 
talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however wasnt feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why? was it because hed seen harry collapse on the train and thought he wasnt up to much? had he thought harry would pass out again? but no one else seemed to have noticed anything did you see me take that banshee? shouted seamus and the hand said dean waving his own around and snape in that hat and my mummy i wonder why professor lupins frightened of crystal balls? said lavender thoughtfully that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson weve ever had wasnt it? said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart   what would it have been for you? said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten? 
d flight of the fat lady in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most peoples favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old houseelf but no one else cared that professor lupins robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy waterdwellers that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in 
a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming snapes shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his grandmothers clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape didnt seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor lupins name and he was bullying neville worse than ever harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor trelawneys stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor trelawneys enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he couldnt like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor trelawneys tower room at lunchtimes and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others didnt they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the actionpacked first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence why would anyone bother looking after them? said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms slimy throats at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes 
the quidditch season was approaching and oliver wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting one thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red soccersized ball through one of the fiftyfoothigh hoops at each end of the field; two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players; a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged walnutsized ball whose capture ended the game and earned the seekers team an extra one hundred and fifty points oliver wood was a burly seventeenyearold now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field this is our last chance  my last chance  to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them ill be leaving at the end of this year ill never get another shot at it gryffindor hasnt won for seven years now okay so weve had the worst luck in the world  injuries  then the tournament getting called off last year  wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know weve got the best  ruddy  team  in  the  school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye weve got three superb chasers 
wood pointed at alicia spinnet angelina johnson and katie bell weve got two unbeatable beaters stop it oliver youre embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush and weve got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought we think youre very good too oliver said george spanking good keeper said fred the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team ive thought the thing was in the bag but we havent got it and this years the last chance well get to finally see our name on the thing  wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic oliver this years our year said fred well do it oliver said angelina definitely said harry full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish harrys wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly whats happened? he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit zonkos im nearly out of stink pellets harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind harry im sure youll be able to go next time she said theyre bound to catch black soon hes been sighted once already blacks not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages ron said hermione harrys supposed to stay in school   he cant be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry   yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth does he have to eat that in front of us? said ron scowling clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself? said hermione crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron just keep him over there thats all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart ive got scabbers asleep in my bag harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but didnt say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
ron dont hurt him squealed hermione; the whole common room was watching; ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top  catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed; scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw ron and hermione hurried over; hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her hes skin and bone you keep that cat away from him crookshanks doesnt understand its wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron theres something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else dyou think   
that cats got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and hes ill ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod hows scabbers? hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail hes hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious whats the matter lavender? said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered its her rabbit binky hes been killed by a fox oh said hermione im sorry lavender i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is? er   the sixteenth of october that thing youre dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember? she was right she was right the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated; then she said you  you were dreading binky being killed by a fox? well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying wasnt i? oh said hermione she paused again then  was binky an old rabbit? n  no sobbed lavender h  he was only a baby parvati tightened her arm around lavenders shoulders but then why would you dread him dying? said hermione parvati glared at her 
well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky didnt even die today did he? lavender just got the news today   lavender wailed loudly   and she cant have been dreading it because its come as a real shock   dont mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she doesnt think other peoples pets matter very much professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky; hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and didnt talk to each other for the whole class harry still hadnt decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first one moment please she called as the class made to leave as youre all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so dont forget neville put up his hand please professor i  i think ive lost   your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well thats all you may leave ask her now ron hissed at harry oh but   hermione began 
go for it harry said ron stubbornly harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor mcgonagalls desk yes potter? harry took a deep breath professor my aunt and uncle  er  forgot to sign my form he said professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didnt say anything so  er  dyou think it would be all right  i mean will it be okay if i  if i go to hogsmeade? professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk im afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village thats the rule but  professor my aunt and uncle  you know theyre muggles they dont really understand about  about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go   but i dont say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity? im sorry potter but thats my final word you had better hurry or youll be late for your next lesson 
there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione; hermione assumed an allforthebest expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade theres always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening yeah said harry gloomily great the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle vernons signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he hadnt had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry its not all its cracked up to be he said seriously all right the sweetshops rather good and zonkos joke shops frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking shacks always worth a visit but really harry apart from that youre not missing anything on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
well bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of harrys difficulties dont worry about me said harry in what he hoped was an offhand voice ill see you at the feast have a good time he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldnt be going staying here potter? shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors? harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower password? said the fat lady jerking out of a doze fortuna major said harry listlessly the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering first and second years and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off harry harry hi harry 
it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him arent you going to hogsmeade harry? why not? hey  colin looked eagerly around at his friends  you can come and sit with us if you like harry er  no thanks colin said harry who wasnt in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i  ive got to go to the library got to get some work done after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again what was the point waking me up? the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind; he didnt feel like working he turned around and came facetoface with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors what are you doing? filch snarled suspiciously nothing said harry truthfully nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own  why arent you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends? harry shrugged 
well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight but harry didnt go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry? harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door what are you doing? said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione? hogsmeade said harry in a wouldbe casual voice ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why dont you come in? ive just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson a what? said harry he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we shouldnt have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers? strong but very brittle the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
cup of tea? lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one all right said harry awkwardly lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin ive only got teabags im afraid  but i daresay youve had enough of tea leaves? harry looked at him lupins eyes were twinkling how did you know about that? harry asked professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea youre not worried are you? no said harry he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog hed seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he didnt want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he couldnt cope with a boggart something of harrys thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry? no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on lupins desk you know that day we fought the boggart? yes said lupin slowly 
why didnt you let me fight it? said harry abruptly lupin raised his eyebrows i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised harry who had expected lupin to deny that hed done any such thing was taken aback why? he said again well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort harry stared not only was this the last answer hed expected but lupin had said voldemort s name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i didnt think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic i didnt think of voldemort said harry honestly i  i remembered those dementors i see said lupin thoughtfully well well  im impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on harrys face that suggests that what you fear most of all is  fear very wise harry harry didnt know what to say to that so he drank some more tea so youve been thinking that i didnt believe you capable of fighting the boggart? said lupin shrewdly 
well  yeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors   he was interrupted by a knock on the door come in called lupin the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me? snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin yes yes i will said lupin i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more i should probably take some again tomorrow thanks very much severus not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry didnt like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a potion brewer and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering why  ? harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question ive been feeling a bit offcolor he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape; there arent many wizards who are up to making it professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands professor snapes very interested in the dark arts he blurted out really? said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion some people reckon   harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon hed do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face disgusting he said well harry id better get back to work ill see you at the feast later right said harry putting down his empty teacup the empty goblet was still smoking there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into harrys lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room pinkfaced from the cold wind and looking as though theyd had the time of their lives thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps whats hogsmeade like? where did you go? by the sound of it  everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop zonkos joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all colorcoded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples theres a bit look   we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks   wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up   what did you do? said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done? no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in  he told them all about the goblet rons mouth fell open  lupin drank it? he gasped is he mad? 
hermione checked her watch wed better go down you know the feastll be starting in five minutes  they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape but if he  you know  hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around  if he was trying to  to poison lupin  he wouldnt have done it in front of harry yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candlefilled pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes the food was delicious; even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were snape s eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural? the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
it had been such a pleasant evening that harrys good mood couldnt even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students why isnt anyone going in? said ron curiously harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed let me through please came percys voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd whats the holdup here? you cant all have forgotten the password  excuse me im head boy   and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick peoples heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe whats going on? said ginny who had just arrived a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait; the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was oh my   hermione grabbed harrys arm 
the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady youll be lucky said a cackling voice it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry what do you mean peeves? said dumbledore calmly and peevess grin faded a little he didnt dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir doesnt want to be seen shes a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly did she say who did it? said dumbledore quietly oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she wouldnt let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from 
between his own legs nasty temper hes got that sirius black 
9 grim defeat professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall im afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes youll be needing  one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against 
the walls; another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes cmon ron said to harry and hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner do you think blacks still in the castle? hermione whispered anxiously dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron its very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we werent in the tower  i reckon hes lost track of time being on the run said ron didnt realize it was halloween otherwise hed have come bursting in here hermione shuddered all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in? maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year he couldve flown in suggested dean thomas honestly am i the only person whos ever bothered to read hogwarts a history? said hermione crossly to harry and ron probably said ron why? because the castles protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you cant just apparate in here and id like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors theyre guarding every single entrance to the grounds theyd have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages theyll have them covered  the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry 
ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as dumbledores footsteps drew nearer any sign of him professor? asked percy in a whisper no all well here? everything under control sir good theres no point moving them all now ive found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole youll be able to move them back in tomorrow and the fat lady sir? hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked shes still very distressed but once shes calmed down ill have mr filch restore her harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps headmaster? it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched hes not there and filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either what about the astronomy tower? professor trelawneys room? the owlery? all searched  very well severus i didnt really expect black to linger 
have you any theory as to how he got in professor? asked snape harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear many severus each of them as unlikely as the next harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; dumbledore s back was to him but he could see percys face rapt with attention and snape s profile which looked angry you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before  ah  the start of term? said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice it seems  almost impossible  that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed   i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape didnt reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete didnt they want to help sir? said percy oh yes said dumbledore coldly but im afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling what was all that about? ron mouthed the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone whod listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub the fat ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day hes a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy cant we get anyone else? none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer sir cadogan however was the least of harrys worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his mothers orders was tailing him everywhere like an 
extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died theres no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black   i know hes after me said harry wearily i heard rons dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter youll understand why i dont think its a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members its very exposed potter   weve got our first match on saturday said harry outraged ive got to train professor professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor teams prospects; it had been she after all whod suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath hmm  professor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain well  goodness knows id like to see us win the cup at last  but all the same potter  id be happier if a teacher were present ill ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of 
madam hooch then at their final training session before saturdays match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news were not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry flints just been to see me were playing hufflepuff instead why? chorused the rest of the team flints excuse is that their seekers arms still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but its obvious why theyre doing it dont want to play in this weather think itll damage their chances  there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder theres nothing wrong with malfoys arm said harry furiously hes faking it i know that but we cant prove it said wood bitterly and weve been practicing all those moves assuming were playing slytherin and instead its hufflepuff and their styles quite different theyve got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory   angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled what? said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior hes that tall goodlooking one isnt he? said angelina strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
hes only silent because hes too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i dont know why youre worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember? we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly diggorys put a very strong side together hes an excellent seeker i was afraid youd take it like this we mustnt relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to wrongfoot us we must win oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed were taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him diggorys got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him   
harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside sorry im late professor lupin i   but it wasnt professor lupin who looked up at him from the teachers desk; it was snape this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think well make it ten points from gryffindor sit down but harry didnt move wheres professor lupin? he said he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down? but harry stayed where he was whats wrong with him? snape s black eyes glittered nothing lifethreatening he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far   
please sir weve done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and were just about to start   be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lupins lack of organization hes the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you  i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss   harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they hadnt covered   werewolves said snape but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself were not supposed to do werewolves yet were due to start hinkypunks   miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page 394 he glanced around again all of you now with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf? said snape 
everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air anyone? snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin hasnt even taught you the basic distinction between   we told you said parvati suddenly we havent got as far as werewolves yet were still on   silencel snarled snape well well well i never thought id meet a third year class who wouldnt even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are  please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf   that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable knowitall hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a knowitall at least once and ron who told hermione she was a knowitall at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you dont want to be told? the class knew instantly hed gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to rons and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin very poorly explained    that is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongolia    professor lupin gave this eight out of ten? i wouldnt have given it three  when the bell rang at last snape held them back you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape snape s never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione whys he got it in for lupin? dyou think this is all because of the boggart? i dont know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon  ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
dyou know what that   he called snape something that made hermione say ron   is making me do? ive got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magid he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why couldnt black have hidden in snapes office eh? he could have finished him off for us harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright  peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear what did you do that for? said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of 
mice around this place  go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; quidditch matches werent called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor; diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but diggorys weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan oh shut up harry yawned he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time hed started on toast the rest of the team had turned up its going to be a tough one said wood who wasnt eating anything stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we dont mind a bit of rain but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran 
down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for woods usual prematch pep talk but it didnt come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they couldnt hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over harrys glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this? the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing canary yellow robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands; diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam hoochs mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant  they were off harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the 
field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he couldnt hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadnt seen them coming he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart  with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam hoochs whistle; harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud i called for timeout wood roared at his team come on under here   they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes whats the score? were fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon well be playing into the night ive got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming ive had an idea harry give me your glasses quick he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said imperviusl there she said handing them back to harry theyll repel water wood looked as though he could have kissed her brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team lets go for it hermione s spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than hed ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction  there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly  he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely  the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
harrys numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished harry came woods anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rainfilled air between them  with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broomhandle and zoomed toward the snitch come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face fasteri but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf  what was going on? and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below    before hed had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it again  someone was screaming screaming inside his head  a woman    not harry not harry please not harry 
 stand aside you silly girl  stand aside now   not harry please no take me kill me instead   numbing swirling white mist was filling harrys brain    what was he doing? why was he flying? he needed to help her  she was going to die  she was going to be murdered  he was falling falling through the icy mist not harry please  have mercy  have mercy  a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more lucky the ground was so soft i thought he was dead for sure but he didnt even break his glasses harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he didnt have a clue where he was or how hed got there or what hed been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten that was the scariest thing ive ever seen in my life scariest    the scariest thing    hooded black figures  cold  screaming  harrys eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there 
looking as though theyd just climbed out of a swimming pool harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud howre you feeling? it was as though harrys memory was on fast forward the lightning  the grim  the snitch  and the dementors  what happened? he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped you fell off said fred mustve been  what  fifty feet? we thought youd died said alicia who was shaking hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot but the match said harry what happened? are we doing a replay? no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone we didnt  lose? diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he didnt realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and square  even wood admits it where is wood? said harry suddenly realizing he wasnt there 
still in the showers said fred we think hes trying to drown himself harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly cmon harry youve never missed the snitch before there had to be one time you didnt get it said george its not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points right? so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin  hufflepuffll have to lose by at least two hundred points said george but if they beat ravenclaw  no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff  it all depends on the points  a margin of a hundred either way   harry lay there not saying a word they had lost  for the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace well come and see you later fred told him dont beat yourself up harry youre still the best seeker weve ever had 
the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to harrys bed dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice ive never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right away  he was furious theyd come onto the grounds we heard him   then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were  his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to him  about the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matteroffact to say did someone get my nimbus? ron and hermione looked quickly at each other er   what? said harry looking from one to the other well  when you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly and? 
and it hit  it hit  oh harry  it hit the whomping willow harrys insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds and? he said dreading the answer well you know the whomping willow said ron it  it doesnt like being hit professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of harrys faithful finally beaten broomstick 
10 the marauders map madam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he didnt argue or complain but he wouldnt let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand he knew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry couldnt help it; he felt as though hed lost one of his best friends he had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a getwell card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he didnt blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left harrys bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better because they knew only half of what was troubling him 
he hadnt told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermione because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by nearfatal accidents; the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus; the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died? was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast? and then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his mothers life her attempts to protect him harry from lord voldemort and voldemorts laughter before he murdered her    harry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on his mothers voice it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things even if he had to endure draco malfoys taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at gryffindors defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next 
potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoy which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindor if snapes teaching defense against the dark arts again im skiving off said ron as they headed toward lupins classroom after lunch check whos in there hermione hermione peered around the classroom door its okay professor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about snapes behavior while lupin had been ill its not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homework? we dont know anything about werewolves     two rolls of parchment did you tell professor snape we havent covered them yet? lupin asked frowning slightly the babble broke out again yes but he said we were really behind     he wouldnt listen   
  two rolls of parchmenti professor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face dont worry ill speak to professor snape you dont have to do the essay oh no said hermione looking very disappointed ive already finished it they had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little onelegged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmlesslooking lures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notes you notice the lantern dangling from his hand? hops ahead  people follow the light  then    the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass when the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but  wait a moment harry lupin called id like a word harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the hinkypunks box with a cloth i heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and im sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing it? 
no said harry the tree smashed it to bits lupin sighed they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye and we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chance did you hear about the dementors too? said harry with difficulty lupin looked at him quickly yes i did i dont think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some time  furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds  i suppose they were the reason you fell? yes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself  why? why do they affect me like that? am i just  ? it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read harrys mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others dont have a ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating lupins gray hairs and the lines on his young face dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places 
they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they cant see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself    soul less and evil youll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broom you have nothing to feel ashamed of when they get near me   harry stared at lupins desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mum lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip harrys shoulder but thought better of it there was a moments silence then  why did they have to come to the match? said harry bitterly theyre getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore wont let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried up  i dont think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitement    emotions running high  it was their idea of a feast azkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimly the fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they dont need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when theyre all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheerful thought most of them go mad within weeks 
but sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got away  lupins briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it yes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i wouldnt have believed it possible  dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long you made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenly there are  certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resist what defenses? said harry at once can you teach me? i dont pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry  quite the contrary  but if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them   lupin looked into harrys determined face hesitated then said well  all right ill try and help but itll have to wait until next term im afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill what with the promise of antidementor lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his mothers death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the 
end of november harrys mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds dumbledores anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances two weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he couldnt stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry wasnt fooled; they were doing it to keep him company and he was very grateful to everyones delight except harrys there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team 
practice an ancient shooting star which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid goodbye to ron and hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quiet psst  harry he turned halfway along the thirdfloor corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked oneeyed witch what are you doing? said harry curiously how come youre not going to hogsmeade? weve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fred with a mysterious wink come in here  he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the oneeyed statue harry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harry early christmas present for you harry he said fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and georges jokes stared at it whats that supposed to be? 
this harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondly its a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your needs greater than ours anyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we dont really need it anymore and what do i need with a bit of old parchment? said harry a bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain george well  when we were in our first year harry  young carefree and innocent   harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocent   well more innocent than we are now  we got into a spot of bother with filch we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason   so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual     detention     disembowelment     and we couldnt help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerous 
dont tell me   said harry starting to grin well what would youve done? said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed  this its not as bad as it sounds you know said george we dont reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it was though or he wouldnt have confiscated it and you know how to work it? oh yes said fred smirking this little beautys taught us more than all the teachers in this school youre winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchment oh are we? said george he took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good and at once thin ink lines began to spread like a spiders web from the point that georges wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimed messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischiefmakers are proud to present the marauders map 
it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it each labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretakers cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor; and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as harrys eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something else this map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead  right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his finger there are seven in all now filch knows about these four  he pointed them out  but were sure were the only ones who know about these dont bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we used it until last winter but its caved in  completely blocked and we dont reckon anyones ever used this one because the whomping willows planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes weve used it loads of times and as you mightve noticed the entrance is right outside this room through that oneeyed old crones hump moony wormtail padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so much noble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers said fred solemnly right said george briskly dont forget to wipe it after youve used it   
  or anyone can read it fred said warningly just tap it again and say ‘mischief managed and itll go blank so young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percy mind you behave yourself see you in honeydukes said george winking they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way harry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really didnt know  he wouldnt have to pass the dementors at all  but even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memory never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning against  aids for magical mischiefmakers    but then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it wasnt as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone  and fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happening  harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger 
then quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the map stuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroom he opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the oneeyed witch what did he have to do? he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the thirdfloor corridor harry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said  dissendium  dissendiurrd harry whispered tapping the stone witch again at once the statues hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forward he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes then heart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set off 
the passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him it took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very cold ten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as he climbed watching his feet  then without warning his head hit something hard it seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he couldnt hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge he was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it  it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door wondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs and get another box of jelly slugs dear theyve nearly cleaned us out   said a womans voice 
a pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance  quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairs slipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes  he ducked crept sideways and then straightened up honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over dudleys piggy face if he could see where harry was now there were shelves upon shelves of the most succulentlooking sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat honeycolored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of every flavor beans and another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbert balls that ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were special effects sweets droobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bluebellcolored bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile sugarspun quills and exploding bonbons harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of 
the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of bloodflavored lollipops harry sneaked up behind them ugh no harry wont want one of those theyre for vampires i expect hermione was saying how about these? said ron shoving ajar of cockroach clusters under hermione s nose definitely not said harry ron nearly dropped the jar harry squealed hermione what are you doing here? how  how did you  ? wow said ron looking very impressed youve learned to apparate  course i havent said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the marauders map how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged im their brother but harry isnt going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous hes going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall arent you harry? no im not said harry are you mad? said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that good? if i hand it in ill have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked it 
but what about sirius black? hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to know he cant be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right? fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three  one of thems caved in so no one can get through it one of thems got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you cant get out of it and the one i just came through  well  its really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was there  harry hesitated what if black did know the passage was there? ron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door  by order of  the ministry of magic customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall merry christmas see? said ron quietly id like to see black try and break into honeydukes with dementors swarming all 
over the village anyway hermione the honeydukes owners would hear a breakin wouldnt they? they live over the shop yes but  but   hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another problem look harry still shouldnt be coming into hogsmeade he hasnt got a signed form if anyone finds out hell be in so much trouble and its not nightfall yet  what if sirius black turns up today? now? hed have a job spotting harry in this said ron nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick swirling snow come on hermione its christmas harry deserves a break hermione bit her lip looking extremely worried are you going to report me? harry asked her grinning oh  of course not  but honestly harry   seen the fizzing whizbees harry? said ron grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs? and the acid pops? fred gave me one of those when i was seven  it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon fredd take a bit of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanuts? when ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outside hogsmeade looked like a christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the 
doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees harry shivered; unlike the other two he didnt have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarves thats the post office   zonkos is up there   we could go up to the shrieking shack   tell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticks? harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn it was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar thats madam rosmerta said ron ill get the drinks shall i? he added going slightly red harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room where there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer merry christmas he said happily raising his tankard 
harry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside a sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a limegreen bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak  cornelius fudge minister of magic in an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of harrys head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and fudges feet move toward the bar pause then turn and walk right toward him somewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbus the christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branches harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a womans voice a small gillywater   
mine said professor mcgonagalls voice four pints of mulled mead   ta rosmerta said hagrid a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella   mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lips so you 11 be the red currant rum minister thank you rosmerta mdear said fudges voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself wont you? come and join us  well thank you very much minister harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why hadnt it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too? and how long were they going to sit there? he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight  hermiones leg gave a nervous twitch next to him so what brings you to this neck of the woods minister? came madam rosmertas voice harry saw the lower part of fudges thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else mdear but sirius black? i daresay you heard what happened up at the school at halloween? i did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmerta 
did you tell the whole pub hagrid? said professor mcgonagall exasperatedly do you think blacks still in the area minister? whispered madam rosmerta im sure of it said fudge shortly you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice? said madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers away  its very bad for business minister rosmerta mdear i dont like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution  unfortunate but there you are  ive just met some of them theyre in a fury against dumbledore  he wont let them inside the castle grounds i should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around? hear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground all the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worse  we all know what blacks capable of  do you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last id have thought  i mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if youd told me then what he was going to become id have said youd had too much mead 
you dont know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did isnt widely known the worst? said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worse than murdering all those poor people you mean? i certainly do said fudge i cant believe that what could possibly be worse? you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta murmured professor mcgonagall do you remember who his best friend was? naturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you? the number of times i had them in here  ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potter harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked him precisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course  exceptionally bright in fact  but i dont think weve ever had such a pair of troublemakers   i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their money youd have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparable of course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when 
james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment him because black turned out to be in league with you knowwho? whispered madam rosmerta worse even than that mdear  fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew you knowwho was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against youknowwho had a number of useful spies one of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course youknow who wasnt an easy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm how does that work? said madam rosmerta breathless with interest professor flitwick cleared his throat an immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or secretkeeper and is henceforth impossible to find  unless of course the secretkeeper chooses to divulge it as long as the secretkeeper refused to speak youknowwho could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window so black was the potters secretkeeper? whispered madam rosmerta naturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell 
where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himself    and yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters secretkeeper himself he suspected black? gasped madam rosmerta he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping youknowwho informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to youknowwho but james potter insisted on using black? he did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed   black betrayed them? breathed madam rosmerta he did indeed black was tired of his doubleagent role he was ready to declare his support openly for youknowwho and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all know youknowwho met his downfall in little harry potter powers gone horribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it   filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quiet shh said professor mcgonagall i met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me 
what rescued harry from lily an jamess house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents dead  an sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know hed bin lily an jamess secretkeeper thought hed jus heard the news o you know whos attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did? i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roared hagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice down how was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james? it was youknowwho he cared abou an then he says ‘give harry ter me hagrid im his godfather ill look after him   ha but id had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an uncles black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there ‘i wont need it anymore he says i shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for? why wouldn he need it anymore? fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew hed bin the potters secretkeeper black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after him but what if id given harry to him eh? i bet he dve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side theres nothin and no one that matters to em anymore  
a long silence followed hagrid s story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he didnt manage to disappear did he? the ministry of magic caught up with him next day alas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew  another of the potters friends maddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters secretkeeper he went after black himself pettigrew    that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts? said madam rosmerta heroworshipped black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league talentwise i was often rather sharp with him you can imagine how i  how i regret that now  she sounded as though she had a sudden head cold there now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a heros death eyewitnesses  muggles of course we wiped their memories later  told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbing lily and james sirius how could you? and then he went for his wand well of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereens  professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boy    foolish boy  he was always hopeless at dueling  should have left it to the ministry  i tell yeh if id got ter black before little pettigrew did i wouldntve messed around with wands  idve ripped him limb  from  limb hagrid growled you dont know what youre talking about hagrid said fudge sharply nobody but trained hit wizards 
from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all those people i  i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of him  a heap of bloodstained robes and a few  a few fragments   fudges voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blown well there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother blacks been in azkaban ever since madam rosmerta let out a long sigh is it true hes mad minister? i wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his masters defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man  cruel  pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; theres no sense in them  but i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to me it was unnerving youd have thought he was merely bored  asked if id finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at 
how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him  and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and night but what do you think hes broken out to do? said madam rosmerta good gracious minister he isnt trying to rejoin youknowwho is he? i daresay that is his  er  eventual plan said fudge evasively but we hope to catch black long before that i must say youknowwho alone and friendless is one thing    but give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly hell rise again  there was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glass you know cornelius if youre dining with the headmaster wed better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagall one by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam rosemertas glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared harry? rons and hermiones faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for words 
the firebolt harry didnt have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard why had nobody ever told him? dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudge  why hadnt anyone ever mentioned the fact that harrys parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them? ron and hermione watched harry nervously all through dinner not daring to talk about what theyd overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of endofterm high spirits harry who didnt want fred and george asking him whether hed reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed 
straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for  the leatherbound photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pages searching until  he stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and there  that must be him their best man  harry had never given him a thought before if he hadnt known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face wasnt sunken and waxy but handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken? was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him? did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizable? but the dementors dont affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he doesnt have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close  harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from view the dormitory door opened harry? said rons voice uncertainly 
but harry lay still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide open a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what blacks voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lord    the potters have made me their secret keeper  and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near    harry you  you look terrible harry hadnt gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tables where is everyone? said harry gone its the first day of the holidays remember? said ron watching harry closely its nearly lunchtime; i was going to come and wake you up in a minute harry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rug 
you really dont look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his face im fine said harry harry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you mustnt go doing anything stupid like what? said harry like trying to go after black said ron sharply harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he didnt say anything you wont will you harry? said hermione because blacks not worth dying for said ron harry looked at them they didnt seem to understand at all dyou know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me? ron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if youd heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you wouldnt forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her   theres nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and hell go back to azkaban and  and serve him right 
you heard what fudge said black isnt affected by azkaban like normal people are its not a punishment for him like it is for the others so what are you saying? said ron looking very tense you want to  to kill black or something? dont be silly said hermione in a panicky voice harry doesnt want to kill anyone do you harry? again harry didnt answer he didnt know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could stand malfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions? ‘if it was me id hunt him down myself  id want revenge  youre going to take malfoy s advice instead of ours? said ron furiously listen  you know what pettigrews mother got back after black had finished with him? dad told me  the order of merlin first class and pettigrews finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find blacks a madman harry and hes dangerous   malfoys dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in voldemorts inner circle    say youknotuwho will you? interjected ron angrily   so obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort     and malfoyd love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip malfoys just 
hoping you 11 get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditch harry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but ddont put yourself in danger its what black wants  oh harry youd be playing right into blacks hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad wouldnt want you to get hurt would they? theyd never want you to go looking for black ill never know what theyd have wanted because thanks to black ive never spoken to them said harry shortly there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws rons pocket quivered look said ron obviously casting around for a change of subject its the holidays its nearly christmas lets  lets go down and see hagrid we havent visited him for ages no said hermione quickly harry isnt supposed to leave the castle ron   yeah lets go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parents further discussion of sirius black plainly wasnt what ron had had in mind or we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set   no lets visit hagrid said harry firmly 
so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole stand and fight you yellowbellied mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors they made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and hagrids cabin looked like an iced cake ron knocked but there was no answer hes not out is he? said hermione who was shivering under her cloak ron had his ear to the door theres a weird noise he said listen  is that fang? harry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans think wed better go and get someone? said ron nervously hagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in there? there was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vest yehve heard? he bellowed and he flung himself onto harrys neck 
hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under hagrids weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard hagrid what is it? said hermione aghast harry spotted an officiallooking letter lying open on the table whats this hagrid? hagrids sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read aloud dear mr hagrid further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident well thats okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid on the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read on however we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoy and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april 20th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the committees offices 
in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated yours in fellowship  there followed a list of the school governors oh said ron but you said buckbeak isnt a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet hell get off   yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleeve theyve got it in fer interestin creatures a sudden sound from the corner of hagrid s cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor i couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmas harry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters on the other hand there didnt seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by hagrids usual standards he was positively cute youll have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermione sitting down and laying a hand on hagrids massive forearm im sure you can prove buckbeak is safe 
wont make no difference sobbed hagrid them disposal devils theyre all in lucius malfoys pocket scared o him an if i lose the case buckbeak   hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat then gave a great wail and lurched forward his face in his arms what about dumbledore hagrid? said harry hes done moren enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around   ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry couldnt bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scared listen hagrid he said you cant give up hermiones right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses   im sure ive read about a case of hippogriffbaiting said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off ill look it up for you hagrid and see exactly what happened hagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help them er  shall i make a cup of tea? said ron harry stared at him its what my mum does whenever someones upset ron muttered shrugging 
at last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself together  fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on hagrid s knee ive not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes we do like them lied hermione at once yeah theyre great said ron crossing his fingers under the table er  how are the flobberworms? dead said hagrid gloomily too much lettuce oh no said ron his lip twitching an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said hagrid with a sudden shudder gotta walk past em evry time i want a drink in the three broomsticks s like bein back in azkaban   he fell silent gulping his tea harry ron and hermione watched him breathlessly they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell in azkaban before after a pause hermione said timidly is it awful in there hagrid? yehve no idea said hagrid quietly never bin anywhere like it thought i was goin mad kep goin over horrible stuff in me mind    the day i got expelled from hogwarts    day me dad died    day i had ter let norbert go  
his eyes filled with tears norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had once won in a game of cards yeh can really remember who yeh are after a while an yeh can see the point o livin at all i used ter hope id jus die in me sleep  when they let me out it was like bein born again evrythin came floodin back it was the bes feelin in the world mind the dementors werent keen on lettin me go but you were innocent said hermione hagrid snorted think that matters to them? they don care long as theyve got a couple o hundred humans stuck there with em so they can leech all the happiness out of em they don give a damn whos guilty an whos not hagrid went quiet for a moment staring into his tea then he said quietly thought o jus letting buckbeak go  tryin ter make him fly away  but how dyeh explain ter a hippogriff its gotta go inter hidin? an  an im scared o breakin the law  he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban the trip to hagrids though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he couldnt brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty 
volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant heres something  there was a case in 1722  but the hippogriff was convicted  ugh look what they did to it thats disgusting   this might help look  a manticore savaged someone in 1296 and they let the manticore off  oh  no that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it  meanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of rons pocket to sniff hopefully at the air on christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him oy presents harry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the semidarkness to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents another sweater from mum    maroon again    see if youve got one 
harry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen homebaked mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneath whats that? said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand dunno  harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look i dont believe it he said hoarsely it was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up he could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail who sent it to you? said ron in a hushed voice look and see if theres a card said harry ron ripped apart the firebolts wrappings nothing blimey whod spend that much on you? well said harry feeling stunned im betting it wasnt the dursleys 
i bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymously  that was my dads though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he wouldnt spend hundreds of galleons on me he cant go giving students stuff like this   thats why he wouldnt say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry  ron gave a great whoop of laughter  malfoyl wait till he sees you on this hell be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this is i cant believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto harrys bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy  who  ? i know said ron controlling himself i know who it couldve been  lupin what? said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin? listen if he had this much gold hed be able to buy himself some new robes yeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbus got smashed and he mightve heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you   what dyou mean he was away? said harry he was ill when i was playing in that match 
well he wasnt in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape remember? harry frowned at ron i cant see lupin affording something like this what re you two laughing about? hermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neck dont bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket but hermione wasnt listening she dropped crookshanks onto seamuss empty bed and stared openmouthed at the firebolt oh harry who sent you that? no idea said harry there wasnt a card or anything with it to his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lip whats the matter with you? said ron i dont know said hermione slowly but its a bit odd isnt it? i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom isnt it? ron sighed exasperatedly 
its the best broom there is hermione he said so it mustve been really expensive  probably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happily well  whod send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him theyd sent it? said hermione who cares? said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it? can i? i dont think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrilly harry and ron looked at her what dyou think harrys going to do with it  sweep the floor? said ron but before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from seamuss bed right at rons chest get  him  out  of  here ron bellowed as crookshanks s claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of harrys bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with pain crookshanks s fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tinny whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle vernons old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor 
i forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help it  the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it youd better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiously sitting on harrys bed nursing his toe cant you shut that thing up? he added to harry as hermione strode out of the room crookshanks s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were rons stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in rons hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of rons pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too hes not looking too good is he? harry said its stress said ron hed be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone but harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years couldnt help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite rons frequent complaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers died christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione 
had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him; ron was still fuming about crookshanks s fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well; she didnt say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat at lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single table set for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledore mcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filch the caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldylooking tailcoat there were only three other students two extremely nervouslooking first years and a sullenfaced slytherin fifth year merry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tables  sit down sit down harry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tugged with a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a large pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture harry remembering the boggart caught rons eye and they both grinned; snape s mouth thinned and 
he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his wizards hat at once dig in he advised the table beaming around as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing up i have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate? i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my lateness  certainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair   and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream i dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteen nothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to die 
well risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall impatiently do sit down the turkeys getting stone cold professor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen tripe sibyll? professor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupin? im afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas day but surely you already knew that sibyll? said professor mcgonagall her eyebrows raised professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look certainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is allknowing i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervous that explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartly professor trelawneys voice suddenly became a good deal less misty 
if you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him  imagine that said professor mcgonagall dryly i doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voice which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor trelawneys conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severus youve made the potion for him again? yes headmaster said snape good said dumbledore then he should be up and about in no time  derek have you had any of these chipolatas? theyre excellent the firstyear boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by dumbledore and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands professor trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of christmas dinner two hours later full to bursting with christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats harry and ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly my dears which of you left his seat first? which? dunno said ron looking uneasily at harry i doubt it will make much difference said professor mcgonagall coldly unless a mad axeman is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall 
even ron laughed professor trelawney looked highly affronted coming? harry said to hermione no hermione muttered i want a quick word with professor mcgonagall probably trying to see if she can take any more classes yawned ron as they made their way into the entrance hall which was completely devoid of mad axemen when they reached the portrait hole they found sir cadogan enjoying a christmas party with a couple of monks several previous headmasters of hogwarts and his fat pony he pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead merry  hie  christmas password? scurvy cur said ron and the same to you sir roared sir cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them harry went straight up to the dormitory collected the firebolt and the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his birthday brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do to the firebolt; however there were no bent twigs to clip and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it he and ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened and hermione came in accompanied by professor mcgonagall though professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house harry had seen her in the common room only 
once before and that had been to make a very grave announcement he and ron stared at her both holding the firebolt hermione walked around them sat down picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it so thats it is it? said professor mcgonagall beadily walking over to the fireside and staring at the firebolt miss granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick potter harry and ron looked around at hermione they could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book which was upside down may i? said professor mcgonagall but she didnt wait for an answer before pulling the firebolt out of their hands she examined it carefully from handle to twigends hmm and there was no note at all potter? no card? no message of any kind? no said harry blankly i see   said professor mcgonagall well im afraid i will have to take this potter w  what? said harry scrambling to his feet why? it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course im no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down   strip it down? repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was mad 
it shouldnt take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagall you will have it back if we are sure it is jinxfree theres nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightly honestly professor   you cant know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindly not until youve flown it at any rate and im afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informed professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of highfinish polish still clutched in his hands ron however rounded on hermione what did you go running to mcgonagall for? hermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantly because i thought  and professor mcgonagall agrees with me  that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius black 
the patronus harry knew that hermione had meant well but that didnt stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he didnt know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of antijinx tests? ron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the strippingdown of a brandnew firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didnt try to persuade her to come back all in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy again 
wood sought harry out on the night before term started had a good christmas? he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said ive been doing some thinking over christmas harry after the last match you know if the dementors come to the next one  i mean    we cant afford you to  well   wood broke off looking awkward im working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said hed train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said hed have time after christmas ah said wood his expression clearing well in that case  i really didnt want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yet? no said harry what youd better get a move on you know  you cant ride that shooting star against ravenclaw he got a firebolt for christmas said ron a firebolt? no seriously? a  a real firebolt? dont get excited oliver said harry gloomily i havent got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxes jinxed? how could it be jinxed? 
sirius black harry said wearily hes supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent it waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black couldnt have bought a firebolt hes on the run the whole countrys on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomstick? i know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down   wood went pale ill go and talk to her harry he promised ill make her see reason  a firebolt  a real firebolt on our team    she wants gryffindor to win as much as we do  ill make her see sense a firebolt  classes started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morning but hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flameloving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling whitehot logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen it was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his antidementor lessons as soon as possible 
ah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me see  how about eight oclock on thursday evening? the history of magic classroom should be large enough  ill have to think carefully about how were going to do this  we cant bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on  still looks ill doesnt he? said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what dyou reckon s the matter with him? there was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermione who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bag which was so full of books it wouldnt close and what are you tutting at us for? said ron irritably nothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulder yes you were said ron i said i wonder whats wrong with lupin and you   well isnt it obvious? said hermione with a look of maddening superiority if you dont want to tell us dont snapped ron fine said hermione haughtily and she marched off she doesnt know said ron staring resentfully after hermione shes just trying to get us to talk to her again at eight oclock on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom 
it was dark and empty when he arrived but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor binns desk whats that? said harry another boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak ive been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filchs filing cabinet its the nearest well get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so well be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when were not using him; theres a cupboard under my desk hell like okay said harry trying to sound as though he wasnt apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor so  professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry  well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charm how does it work? said harry nervously well when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupin which is a kind of anti dementor  a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a hagridsized figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon  hope happiness the desire 
to survive  but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors cant hurt it but i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with it what does a patronus look like? said harry curiously each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it and how do you conjure it? with an incantation which will work only if you are concentrating with all your might on a single very happy memory harry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick right he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful soaring sensation of his stomach the incantation is this   lupin cleared his throat expecto patronum expecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronum concentrating hard on your happy memory? oh  yeah   said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono  no patronum  sorry  expecto patronum expecto patronum   
something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas did you see that? said harry excitedly something happened very good said lupin smiling right then  ready to try it on a dementor? yes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flying but something else kept intruding    any second now he might hear his mother again    but he shouldnt think that or he would hear her again and he didnt want to  or did he? lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled a dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps around the classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him  expecto patronurrd harry yelled expecto patronum expecto   but the classroom and the dementor were dissolving    harry was falling again through thick white fog and his mothers voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head   not harry not harry please  ill do anything   stand aside stand aside girl harry 
harry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floor the classroom lamps were alight again he didnt have to ask what had happened sorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses are you all right? said lupin yes  harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it here   lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i didnt expect you to do it your first time; in fact i would have been astounded if you had its getting worse harry muttered biting off the frogs head i could hear her louder that time  and him  voldemort   lupin looked paler than usual harry if you dont want to continue i will more than understand   i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth ive got to what if the dementors turn up at our match against ravenclaw? i cant afford to fall off again if we lose this game weve lost the quidditch cup all right then   said lupin you might want to select another memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate on  that one doesnt seem to have been strong enough  harry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last 
year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom ready? said lupin gripping the box lid ready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened go said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward harry  expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronuml expecto pat   white fog obscured his senses    big blurred shapes were moving around him  then came a new voice a mans voice shouting panicking  lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off~ the sounds of someone stumbling from a room  a door bursting open  a cackle of highpitched laughter  harry harry  wake up  lupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor i heard my dad harry mumbled thats the first time ive ever heard him  he tried to take on 
voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for it harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin wouldnt see you heard james? said lupin in a strange voice yeah  face dry harry looked up why  you didnt know my dad did you? i  i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry  perhaps we should leave it here for tonight this charm is ridiculously advanced  i shouldnt have suggested putting you through this  no said harry he got up again ill have one more go im not thinking of happy enough things thats what it is  hang on  he racked his brains a really really happy memory    one that he could turn into a good strong patronus  the moment when hed first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that wasnt a happy memory he didnt know what was  concentrating very hard on how he had felt when hed realized hed be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more ready? said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard? all right  go 
he pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark  expecto patronum  harry bellowed  expecto patronum expecto patronum  the screaming inside harrys head had started again  except this time it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio  softer and louder and softer again  and he could still see the dementor  it had halted  and then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of harrys wand to hover between him and the dementor and though harrys legs felt like water he was still on his feet  though for how much longer he wasnt sure   riddikulusv roared lupin springing forward there was a loud crack and harrys cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if hed just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again excellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellent harry that was definitely a start can we have another go? just one more go? not now said lupin firmly youve had enough for one night here   he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolate 
eat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next week? okay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to him professor lupin? he said if you knew my dad you mustve known sirius black as well lupin turned very quickly what gives you that idea? he said sharply nothing  i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts too  lupins face relaxed yes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did youd better be off harry its getting late harry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he hadnt mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then harrys thoughts wandered back to his mother and father  he felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but hed never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again  
theyre dead he told himself sternly theyre dead and listening to echoes of them wont bring them back youd better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cup he stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor tower ravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week this meant that with lupins anti dementor classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he wasnt showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy charts rune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted hows she doing it? ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books doing what? getting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about yesterdays lesson but hermione cantve been there because she 
was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me shes never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and shes never missed one of them either harry didnt have time to fathom the mystery of hermiones impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with snapes essay two seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by wood bad news harry ive just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she  er  got a bit shirty with me told me id got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i didnt care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at me    youd think id said something terrible  then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it  he screwed up his face and imitated professor mcgonagalls severe voice  ‘as long as necessary wood  i reckon its time you ordered a new broom harry theres an order form at the back of which broomstick  you could get a nimbus two thousand and one like malfoys got im not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatly january faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still hadnt ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron 
standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face averted no potter you cant have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before hed even opened his mouth weve checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell you once weve finished checking it now please stop badgering me to make matters even worse harrys antidementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the boggart dementor approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himself guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices again youre expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a thirteenyearold wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you arent passing out anymore are you? i thought a patronus would  charge the dementors down or something said harry dispiritedly make them disappear   the true patronus does do that said lupin but youve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground 
you said its harder if there are loads of them said harry i have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here  youve earned a drink  something from the three broomsticks you wont have tried it before   he pulled two bottles out of his briefcase butterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stuff lupin raised an eyebrow oh  ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quickly i see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well  lets drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that im supposed to take sides as a teacher   he added hastily they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something hed been wondering for a while whats under a dementors hood? professor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully hmmm  well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon whats that? they call it the dementors kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile its what dementors do to 
those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and  and suck out his soul harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer what  they kill  ? oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but you 11 have no sense of self anymore no memory no  anything theres no chance at all of recovery youll just  exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone forever  lost lupin drank a little more butterbeer then said its the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of black he deserves it he said suddenly you think so? said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves that? yes said harry defiantly for  for some things  he would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation hed overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that hed gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin wouldnt be very impressed by that so he 
finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroom harry half wished that he hadnt asked what was under a dementors hood the answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairs do watch where youre going potter sorry professor   ive just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room well here it is weve done everything we could think of and there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with it at all youve got a very good friend somewhere potter  harrys jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as ever i can have it back? harry said weakly seriously? seriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay youll need to get the feel of it before saturdays match wont you? and potter  do try and win wont you? or well be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last night speechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to ear 
she gave it to you? excellent listen can i still have a go on it? tomorrow? yeah  anything  said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what  we should make up with hermione  she was only trying to help  yeah all right said ron shes in the common room now  working for a change   they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrance i wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i mustve dropped them somewhere a likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers within oh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with neville ive lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i dont know what ive done with them oddsbodikins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his firebolt where d you get it harry? 
will you let me have a go? have you ridden it yet harry? ravenclawll have no chance theyre all on cleansweep sevens can i just hold it harry? after ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who hadnt rushed over to them bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked up i got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the firebolt see hermione? there wasnt anything wrong with it said ron well  there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that its safe yeah i suppose so said harry id better put it upstairs   ill take it said ron eagerly ive got to give scabbers his rat tonic he took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glass carried it away up the boys staircase can i sit down then? harry asked hermione i suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chair 
harry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring over how are you getting through all this stuff? harry asked her oh well  you know  working hard said hermione closeup harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupin why dont you just drop a couple of subjects? harry asked watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary i couldnt do that said hermione looking scandalized arithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very complicatedlooking number chart oh no its wonderful said hermione earnestly its my favorite subject its   but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found out at that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder  and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheet look he bellowed striding over to hermiones table look he yelled shaking the sheets in her face ron what  ? 
scabbers look scabbers hermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on it something that looked horribly like  blood ron yelled into the stunned silence hes gone and you know what was on the floor? n  no said hermione in a trembling voice ron threw something down onto hermione s rune translation hermione and harry leaned forward lying on top of the weird spiky shapes were several long ginger cat hairs 
gryffindor versus ravenclaw it looked like the end of ron and hermiones friendship each was so angry with the other that harry couldnt see how theyd ever make up ron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshankss attempts to eat scabbers seriously hadnt bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys beds hermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on rons head in the magical menagerie personally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry too 
okay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers everythings my fault isnt it just leave me alone harry ive got a lot of work to do ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed come on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and hes been offcolor for ages he was wasting away it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly  one swallow  he probably didnt feel a thing fred said ginny indignantly all he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said george he bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harry? yeah thats true said harry his finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on goyle s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory oh come on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat whats the point of moaning? in a lastditch attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor teams final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after theyd finished this did seem to take rons mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it? so they set off for the quidditch field together madam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as 
impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion look at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault its a slight list to the tail end  you often find they develop a drag after a few years theyve updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows  a pity theyve stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was too  she continued in this vein for some time until wood said er  madam hooch? is it okay if harry has the firebolt back? we need to practice  oh  right  here you are then potter said madam hooch ill sit over here with weasley  she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrows match harry ive just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker its cho chang shes a fourth year and shes pretty good  i really hoped she wouldnt be fit shes had some problems with injuries  wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave harrys broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone lets go and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the ground it was better than hed ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his 
thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green andgray blur; harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air again  harry im letting the snitch out wood called harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand the team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a minutes head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near katie bells knee looped her easily and caught it again it was the best practice ever; the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood didnt have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a first i cant see whats going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless  harry youve sorted out your dementor problem havent you? yeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were stronger the dementors wont turn up again oliver dumbledored go ballistic said fred confidently 
well lets hope not said wood anyway  good work everyone lets get back to the tower  turn in early   im staying out for a bit; ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms harry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat here you go said harry handing ron the firebolt ron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castle harry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the firebolts superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over  a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darkness harry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribs whats the matter? said ron harry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumos 
a beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches; there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanks get out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail see? ron said furiously chucking the stone down again shes still letting him wander about wherever he wants  probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds now  harry didnt say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry didnt say anything to ron  nor did he look left or right until they had reached the welllit entrance hall harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck did you see his face? said ron gleefully looking back at malfoy he cant believe it this is brilliant wood too was basking in the reflected glory of the firebolt put it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its 
name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look cedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and percys ravenclaw girlfriend penelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the firebolt now now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the team ten galleons on the outcome of the match penelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her table harry  make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i havent got ten galleons yes im coming penny and he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast sure you can manage that broom potter? said a cold drawling voice draco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and goyle right behind him yeah reckon so said harry casually got plenty of special features hasnt it? said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it doesnt come with a parachute  in case you get too near a dementor crabbe and goyle sniggered pity you cant attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for you 
the gryffindor team laughed loudly malfoys pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin team who put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether harrys broom really was a firebolt at a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather couldnt have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the tshirt he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he wouldnt need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watching you know what weve got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match were out of the running just  just fly like you did in practice yesterday and well be okay they walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the field their seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry couldnt help noticing nervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didnt think had anything to do with nerves 
wood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shook hands with the ravenclaw captain mount your brooms  on my whistle    three  two  one   harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordan theyre off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstick the firebolts going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this years world championship   jordan would you mind telling us whats going on in the match? interrupted professor mcgonagalls voice right you are professor  just giving a bit of background information  the firebolt incidentally has a builtin autobrake and   jordan okay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goal  harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier  she kept cutting across him forcing him to change direction 
show her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it  the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriers harry dived; cho saw what he was doing and tore after him  harry was speeding up excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality he was ten feet away  then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere; harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go potters really putting it through its paces now see it turn  changs comet is just no match for it the firebolts precisionbalance is really noticeable in these long   jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts? get on with the commentary ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points 
ahead  if cho got the snitch before him ravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically  a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings  the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post  harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead  but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him  harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have to harry turned and caught sight of cho; she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him  shed decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herself    all right then  if she wanted to tail him shed have to take the consequences  he dived again and cho thinking hed seen the snitch tried to follow; harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time  the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end he accelerated; so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second  then  oh screamed cho pointing distracted harry looked down 
three dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at him he didnt stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronum something silverwhite something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didnt pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead  he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitch madam hoochs whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd thats my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry; fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd yes ron yelled yanking harrys arm into the air yes yes well done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me   good for you harry roared seamus finnigan 
ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindors that was quite some patronus said a voice in harrys ear harry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleased the dementors didnt affect me at all harry said excitedly i didnt feel a thing that would be because they  er  werent dementors said professor lupin come and see   he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field you gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupin harry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy crabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on goyle s shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagall an unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes now if anything could have set the seal on gryffindors victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to harrys side doubled up with laughter as 
they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe goyles head still stuck inside it come on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room now right said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup; the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweets how did you do that? squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowd with a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in harrys ear only one person wasnt joining in the festivities hermione incredibly was sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her did you even come to the match? he asked her of course i did said hermione in a strangely high pitched voice not looking up and im very glad we 
won and i think you did really well but i need to read this by monday come on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet i cant harry ive still got four hundred and twenty two pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway  she glanced over at ron too he doesnt want me to join in there was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudly if scabbers hadnt just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them   hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sight cant you give her a break? harry asked ron quietly no said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry  but shell never admit shes wrong hermione shes still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or something the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his fourposter shut to block out a ray of 
moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep  he had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something silvery white it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a run and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat out and ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and  aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggggghhhhh  nooooooooooooooooo harry woke as suddenly as though hed been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings  he could hear movements around him and seamus finnigans voice from the other side of the room whats going on? harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same moment dean thomas lit his lamp ron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face black sirius black with a knife what? here just now slashed the curtains woke me up you sure you werent dreaming ron? said dean 
look at the curtains i tell you he was here they all scrambled out of bed; harry reached the dormitory door first and they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after them who shouted? what re you doing? the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was deserted are you sure you werent dreaming ron? im telling you i saw him whats all the noise? professor mcgonagall told us to go to bed a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling on dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearing excellent are we carrying on? said fred weasley brightly everyone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke perce  sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me up the common room went very still 
nonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron  had a nightmare   im telling you   now really enoughs enough professor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around i am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of you i certainly didnt authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all to get back to bed my brother ron here had a nightmare   it wasnt a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knife professor mcgonagall stared at him dont be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole? ask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir cadogans picture ask him if he saw   glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor tower? 
certainly good lady cried sir cadogan there was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common room you  you did? said professor mcgonagall but  but the password he had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole weeks my lady read em off a little piece of paper professor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalk which person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this weeks passwords and left them lying around? there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks neville longbottom trembling from head to fluffyslippered toes raised his hand slowly into the air 
snapes grudge no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black; filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
harry couldnt help noticing that the statue of the oneeyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they  and now harry ron and hermione  were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it dyou reckon we should tell someone? harry asked ron we know hes not coming in through honey dukes said ron dismissively wedve heard if the shop had been broken into harry was glad ron took this view if the oneeyed witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the nights events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail  i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know? but then there was this draft  i woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down  i rolled over    and i saw him standing over me    like a skeleton with loads of filthy hair    holding this great long knife mustve been twelve inches  and he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered why though? ron added to harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run? 
harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry? black had proved twelve years ago that he didnt mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep he mustve known hed have a job getting back out of the castle once youd yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully hedve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole    then he wouldve met the teachers  neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after blacks breakin she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast  a howler the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once  ron had got one from his mother the year before run for it neville ron advised neville didnt need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they 
heard the howler go off in the entrance hall  nevilles grandmothers voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist ouch oh  thanks hedwig harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of nevilles cornflakes the note inside said dear harry and ron how about having tea with me this afternoon round six? ill come and collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall; youre not allowed out on your own cheers hagrid he probably wants to hear all about black said ron so at six oclock that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall hagrid was already waiting for them 
all right hagrid said ron spose you want to hear about saturday night do you? ive already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside oh said ron looking slightly put out the first thing they saw on entering hagrids cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of hagrids patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellowandorange tie hanging from the top of hagrids wardrobe door what are they for hagrid? said harry buckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an mell be goin down ter london together ive booked two beds on the knight bus  harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that buckbeaks trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on rons face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare buckbeaks defense; the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with hagrids cooking i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
what? said harry hermione said hagrid what about her? said ron shes in a righ state thats what shes bin cornin down ter visit me a lot since chris mas bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat     ate scabbers ron interjected angrily because her cat acted like all cats do hagrid continued doggedly shes cried a fair few times yeh know goin through a rough time at the moment bitten off moren she can chew if yeh ask me all the work shes tryin ter do still found time ter help me with buckbeaks case mind  shes found some really good stuff fer me  reckon hell stand a good chance now  hagrid we shouldve helped as well  sorry   harry began awkwardly im not blamin yeh said hagrid waving harrys apology aside gawd knows yehve had enough ter be gettin on with ive seen yeh practicin quidditch evry hour o the day an night  but i gotta tell yeh i thought you twod value yer friend moren broomsticks or rats thas all harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron shes got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her   
if shed just get rid of that cat id speak to her again ron said angrily but shes still sticking up for it its a maniac and she wont hear a word against it ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto hagrids pillow they spent the rest of their visit discussing gryffindors improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine oclock hagrid walked them back up to the castle a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what dyou reckon? he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down well filch hasnt done anything about the passage into honeydukes  harry said even more quietly harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her harry if you go into hogsmeade again  ill tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione can you hear someone talking harry? growled ron not looking at hermione 
ron how can you let him go with you? after what sirius black nearly did to youl i mean it ill tell   so now youre trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously havent you done enough damage this year? hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on rons face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories so how about it? ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you didnt see anything you havent even been inside zonkos yet harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot okay he said but im taking the invisibility cloak this time on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the marauders map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors  bye harry called to ron see you when you get back ron grinned and winked 
harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the marauders map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the oneeyed witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered  dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner harry i forgot you werent going to hogsmeade either hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to? nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap? er  not now  i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin   ill come with you said neville brightly i havent done it either er  hang on  yeah i forgot i finished it last night great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i dont understand that thing about the garlic at all  do they have to eat it or   he broke off with a small gasp looking over harrys shoulder it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
and what are you two doing here? said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet   to harrys immense disquiet snapes black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the oneeyed witch were not  meeting here said harry we just  met here indeed? said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reason  i suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the oneeyed witchs head examining it closely harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending hed left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office he sprinted back to the oneeyed witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the marauders map blank again then set off at a run 
harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back its me he muttered what kept you? ron hissed snape was hanging around  they set off up the high street where are you? ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there? this feels weird  they went to the post office; ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them; from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of harrys hand then they visited zonkos which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even freds and georges wildest dreams; harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left zonkos with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a nosebiting teacup apiece the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in 
britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nick  he says hes heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking  should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm    about how i couldnt use it for three months  crabbe and goyle sniggered i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself  theres no arm in im onest      that hippogriffs as good as dead   malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin what are you doing weasley? malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron suppose youd love to live here wouldnt you weasley? dreaming about having your own bedroom? i heard your family all sleep in one room  is that true? 
harry seized the back of rons robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy leave him to me he hissed in rons ear the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what hes saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures dyou think hell cry when they cut off his hippogriffs   splat malfoys head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck what the  ? ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean what was that? who did that? very haunted up here isnt it? said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foulsmelling green sludge splatter crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at crabbe s back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled  and his huge flat foot caught the hem of harrys cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face for a split second malfoy stared at him aaargh he yelled pointing at harrys head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared youd better run for it if malfoy tells anyone  youd better get back to the castle quick   
see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade would malfoy believe what he had seen? would anyone believe malfoy? nobody knew about the invisibility cloak  nobody except dumbledore harrys stomach turned over  dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything  back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor  harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passage  malfoy would get back first    how long would it take him to find a teacher? panting a sharp pain in his side harry didnt slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher  he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the witchs hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out; the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him so he said there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets come with me potter said snape 
harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into snapes office harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere sit said snape harry sat snape however remained standing mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape harry didnt say anything he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley  apparently alone still harry didnt speak mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened? harry tried to look mildly surprised i dont know professor snapes eyes were boring into harrys it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter? no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious it was your head potter floating in midair there was a long silence maybe hed better go to madam pomfrey said harry if hes seeing things like   what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter? said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like malfoys having hallucin   malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of harrys chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you ive been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told   can anyone confirm that? harry didnt say anything snapes thin mouth curled into a horrible smile so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the 
ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he wasnt going to do it snape had no proof  yet how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirers    the resemblance between you is uncanny my dad didnt strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i your father didnt set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch cupwinners his head was so swollen   shut up harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he didnt care that snapes face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously  what did you say to me potter? i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right? he saved your life dumbledore told me you wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for my dad 
snapes sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life? he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious potters delicate ears? harry bit his lip he didnt know what had happened and didnt want to admit it  but snape seemed to have guessed the truth i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? then let me correct you  your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadnt got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts snapes uneven yellowish teeth were bared turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly harry didnt move there was a pounding in his ears turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of zonkos tricks and the marauders map snape picked up the zonkos bag 
ron gave them to me said harry praying hed get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he  brought them back from hogsmeade last time   indeed? and youve been carrying them around ever since? how very touching    and what is this? snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug snape turned it over his eyes on harry surely you dont need such a very old piece of parchment? he said why dont i just  throw this away? his hand moved toward the fire no harry said quickly so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley? or is it  something else? a letter perhaps written in invisible ink? or  instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors? harry blinked snape s eyes gleamed let me see let me see   he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map mr moony presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other peoples business snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map didnt stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first mr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git it would have been very funny if the situation hadnt been so serious and there was more  mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor harry closed his eyes in horror when hed opened them the map had had its last word mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball harry waited for the blow to fall so   said snape softly well see about this  
he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from ajar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames lupin snape called into the fire i want a word utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes you called severus? said lupin mildly i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on lupins face well? said snape lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking well? said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing? lupin looked up and by the merest halfglance in harrys direction warned him not to interrupt full of dark magic? he repeated mildly do you really think so severus? it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who 
reads it childish but surely not dangerous? i imagine harry got it from a joke shop   indeed? said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? you dont think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers? harry didnt understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people? he said harry do you know any of these men? no said harry quickly you see severus? said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me   right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of snape s desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak i  gave  harry  that  stuff he choked bought  it  in zonko s  ages  ago  well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus ill take this back shall i? he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay  excuse us severus   harry didnt dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
professor i   i dont want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know its a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i dont want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you didnt hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i cant let you have it back harry harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest why did snape think id got it from the manufacturers? because   lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school theyd think it extremely entertaining do you know them? said harry impressed weve met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before dont expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them  gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in snape s office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry 
passed the oneeyed witch he remembered the invisibility cloak  it was still down there but he didnt dare go and get it its my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go lupins right it was stupid we shouldntve done it   he broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted  had she told professor mcgonagall? come to have a good gloat? said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us? no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to know  hagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed

theres still the appeal said ron fiercely dont give up yet were working on it they were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class ahead they could see malfoy who was walking with crabbe and goyle and kept looking back laughing derisively sno good ron said hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps that committees in lucius malfoy s pocket im jus gonna make sure the rest o beakys time is the happiest hes ever had i owe him that  hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin his face buried in his handkerchief look at him blubber malfoy crabbe and goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors listening have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic? said malfoy and hes supposed to be our teacher harry and ron both made furious moves toward malfoy but hermione got there first  smack she had slapped malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster malfoy staggered harry ron crabbe and goyle stood flabbergasted as hermione raised her hand again dont you dare call hagrid pathetic you foul  you evil   hermione said ron weakly and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back get off ron 
hermione pulled out her wand malfoy stepped backward crabbe and goyle looked at him for instructions thoroughly bewildered cmon malfoy muttered and in a moment all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons hermionel ron said again sounding both stunned and impressed harry youd better beat him in the quidditch final hermione said shrilly you just better had because i cant stand it if slytherin wins were due in charms said ron still goggling at hermione wed better go they hurried up the marble staircase toward professor flitwicks classroom youre late boys said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry opened the classroom door come along quickly wands out were experimenting with cheering charms today weve already divided into pairs   harry and ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags ron looked behind him wheres hermione gone? harry looked around too hermione hadnt entered the classroom yet harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door thats weird said harry staring at ron maybe  maybe she went to the bathroom or something? 
but hermione didnt turn up all lesson she couldve done with a cheering charm on her too said ron as the class left for lunch all grinning broadly  the cheering charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment hermione wasnt at lunch either by the time they had finished their apple pie the aftereffects of the cheering charms were wearing off and harry and ron had started to get slightly worried you dont think malfoy did something to her? ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward gryffindor tower they passed the security trolls gave the fat lady the password flibbertigibbet and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room hermione was sitting at a table fast asleep her head resting on an open arithmancy book they went to sit down on either side of her harry prodded her awake wh  what? said hermione waking with a start and staring wildly around is it time to go? w  which lesson have we got now? divination but its not for another twenty minutes said harry hermione why didnt you come to charms? what? oh no hermione squeaked i forgot to go to charms but how could you forget? said harry you were with us till we were right outside the classroom 
i dont believe it hermione wailed was professor flitwick angry? oh it was malfoy i was thinking about him and i lost track of things you know what hermione? said ron looking down at the enormous arithmancy book hermione had been using as a pillow i reckon youre cracking up youre trying to do too much no im not said hermione brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag i just made a mistake thats all id better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry  ill see you in divination hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to professor trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later looking extremely harassed i cant believe i missed cheering charms and i bet they come up in our exams; professor flitwick hinted they might together they climbed the ladder into the dim stifling tower room glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist harry ron and hermione sat down together at the same rickety table i thought we werent starting crystal balls until next term ron muttered casting a wary eye around for professor trelawney in case she was lurking nearby dont complain this means weve finished palmistry harry muttered back i was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands good day to you said the familiar misty voice and professor trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows parvati and lavender 
quivered with excitement their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball i have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than i had planned said professor trelawney sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around the fates have informed me that your examination in june will concern the orb and i am anxious to give you sufficient practice hermione snorted well honestly  ‘the fates have informed her  who sets the exam? she does what an amazing prediction she said not troubling to keep her voice low harry and ron choked back laughs it was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow she continued however as though she had not crystal gazing is a particularly refined art she said dreamily i do not expect any of you to see when first you peer into the orbs infinite depths we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes  ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise  so as to clear the inner eye and the superconscious perhaps if we are lucky some of you will see before the end of the class and so they began harry at least felt extremely foolish staring blankly at the crystal ball trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it it didnt help that ron kept breaking into silent giggles and hermione kept tutting 
seen anything yet? harry asked them after a quarter of an hours quiet crystal gazing yeah theres a burn on this table said ron pointing someones spilled their candle this is such a waste of time hermione hissed i could be practicing something useful i could be catching up on cheering charms   professor trelawney rustled past would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their orb? she murmured over the clinking of her bangles i dont need help ron whispered its obvious what this means theres going to be loads of fog tonight both harry and hermione burst out laughing now really said professor trelawney as everyones heads turned in their direction parvati and lavender were looking scandalized you are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations she approached their table and peered into their crystal ball harry felt his heart sinking he was sure he knew what was coming  there is something here professor trelawney whispered lowering her face to the ball so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses something moving    but what is it? harry was prepared to bet everything he owned including his firebolt that it wasnt good news whatever it was and sure enough  my dear   professor trelawney breathed gazing up at harry it is here plainer than ever before  my 
dear stalking toward you growing ever closer  the gr   oh for goodness sake said hermione loudly not that ridiculous grim again professor trelawney raised her enormous eyes to hermione s face parvati whispered something to lavender and they both glared at hermione too professor trelawney stood up surveying hermione with unmistakable anger i am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of divination requires indeed i dont remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane there was a moments silence then  fine said hermione suddenly getting up and cramming unfogging the future back into her bag fine she repeated swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking ron off his chair i give up im leaving and to the whole classs amazement hermione strode over to the trapdoor kicked it open and climbed down the ladder out of sight it took a few minutes for the class to settle down again professor trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the grim she turned abruptly from harry and rons table breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her ooooo said lavender suddenly making everyone start oooooo professor trelawney ive just remembered you saw her leaving didnt you? didnt 
you professor? ‘around easter one of our number will leave us forever you said it ages ago professor professor trelawney gave her a dewy smile yes my dear i did indeed know that miss granger would be leaving us one hopes however that one might have mistaken the signs  the inner eye can be a burden you know  lavender and parvati looked deeply impressed and moved over so that professor trelawney could join their table instead some day hermiones having eh? ron muttered to harry looking awed yeah  harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist had professor trelawney really seen the grim again? would he? the last thing he needed was another nearfatal accident with the quidditch final drawing ever nearer the easter holidays were not exactly relaxing the third years had never had so much homework neville longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse and he wasnt the only one call this a holiday seamus finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon the exams are ages away whatre they playing at? but nobody had as much to do as hermione even without divination she was taking more subjects than anybody else she was usually last to leave the common room at night first to arrive at the library 
the next morning; she had shadows like lupins under her eyes and seemed constantly close to tears ron had taken over responsibility for buckbeaks appeal when he wasnt doing his own work he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like the handbook of hippogriff psychology and fowl or foul? a study of hippogriff brutality he was so absorbed he even forgot to be horrible to crookshanks harry meanwhile had to fit in his homework around quidditch practice every day not to mention endless discussions of tactics with wood the gryffindor slytherin match would take place on the first saturday after the easter holidays slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points this meant as wood constantly reminded his team that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the cup it also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on harry because capturing the snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points so you must catch it only if were more than fifty points up wood told harry constantly only if were more than fifty points up harry or we win the match but lose the cup youve got that havent you? you must catch the snitch only if were   i know oliver harry yelled the whole of gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming match gryffindor hadnt won the quidditch cup since the legendary charlie weasley rons second oldest brother had been seeker but harry doubted whether any of them even wood wanted to win as much as he did the enmity between harry and malfoy was at its highest point ever malfoy was 
still smarting about the mudthrowing incident in hogsmeade and was even more furious that harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment harry hadnt forgotten malfoys attempt to sabotage him in the match against ravenclaw but it was the matter of buckbeak that made him most determined to beat malfoy in front of the entire school never in anyones memory had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere by the time the holidays were over tension between the two teams and their houses was at the breaking point a number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors culminating in a nasty incident in which a gryffindor fourth year and a slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears harry was having a particularly bad time of it he couldnt walk to class without slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; crabbe and goyle kept popping up wherever he went and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people wood had given instructions that harry should be accompanied everywhere he went in case the slytherins tried to put him out of action the whole of gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically so that it was impossible for harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast chattering crowd harry was more concerned for his firebolts safety than his own when he wasnt flying it he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor tower at break times to check that it was still there all usual pursuits were abandoned in the gryffindor common room the night before the match even hermione had put down her books i cant work i cant concentrate she said nervously 
there was a great deal of noise fred and george weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever oliver wood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the corner prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself angelina alicia and katie were laughing at freds and georges jokes harry was sitting with ron and hermione removed from the center of things trying not to think about the next day because every time he did he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach youre going to be fine hermione told him though she looked positively terrified youve got a firebolti said ron yeah   said harry his stomach writhing it came as a relief when wood suddenly stood up and yelled team bed harry slept badly first he dreamed that he had overslept and that wood was yelling where were you? we had to use neville instead then he dreamed that malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons he was flying at breakneck speed trying to avoid a spurt of flames from malfoy s steeds mouth when he realized he had forgotten his firebolt he fell through the air and woke with a start it was a few seconds before harry remembered that the match hadnt taken place yet that he was safe in bed and that the slytherin team definitely wouldnt be allowed to play on dragons he was feeling very 
thirsty quietly as he could he got out of his four poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window the grounds were still and quiet no breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the forbidden forest; the whomping willow was motionless and innocent looking it looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye an animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn harry dashed to his bedside table snatched up his glasses and put them on then hurried back to the window it couldnt be the grim  not now  not right before the match  he peered out at the grounds again and after a minutes frantic searching spotted it it was skirting the edge of the forest now  it wasnt the grim at all it was a cat  harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail it was only crookshanks  or was it only crookshanks? harry squinted pressing his nose flat against the glass crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too and just then it emerged  a gigantic shaggy black dog moving stealthily across the lawn crookshanks trotting at its side harry stared what did this mean? if crookshanks could see the dog as well how could it be an omen of harrys death? ron harry hissed ron wake up 
huh? i need you to tell me if you can see something sall dark harry ron muttered thickly whatre you on about? down here   harry looked quickly back out of the window crookshanks and the dog had vanished harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle but they werent there where had they gone? a loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep again harry and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall the next day to enormous applause harry couldnt help grinning broadly as he saw that both the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were applauding them too the slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed harry noticed that malfoy looked even paler than usual wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat while touching nothing himself then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished so they could get an idea of the conditions as they left the great hall everyone applauded again good luck harry called cho harry felt himself blushing okay  no wind to speak of  suns a bit bright that could impair your vision watch out for it  grounds fairly hard good thatll give us a fast kickoff ?? 
wood paced the field staring around with the team behind him finally they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn locker rooms said wood tersely none of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes harry wondered if they were feeling like he was as though hed eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast in what seemed like no time at all wood was saying okay its time lets go   they walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise threequarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes waving scarlet flags with the gryffindor lion upon them or brandishing banners with slogans like go gryffindor and lions for the cup behind the slytherin goal posts however two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of slytherin glittered on their flags and professor snape sat in the very front row wearing green like everyone else and a very grim smile and here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan who was acting as commentator as usual potter bell johnson spinnet weasley weasley and wood widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in a good few years   lees comments were drowned by a tide of boos from the slytherin end and here come the slytherin team led by captain flint hes made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill   more boos from the slytherin crowd harry however thought lee had a point malfoy was easily the 
smallest person on the slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous captains shake hands said madam hooch flint and wood approached each other and grasped each others hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the others fingers mount your brooms said madam hooch three  two  one  the sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around saw malfoy on his tail and sped off in search of the snitch and its gryffindor in possession alicia spinnet of gryffindor with the quaffle heading straight for the slytherin goal posts looking good alicia argh no  quaffle intercepted by warrington warrington of slytherin tearing up the field  wham  nice bludger work there by george weasley warrington drops the quaffle its caught by  johnson gryffindor back in possession come on angelina  nice swerve around montague  duck angelina thats a bludger]  she scores tenzero to gryffindor angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight  ouch angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as marcus flint went smashing into her 
sorry said flint as the crowd below booed sorry didnt see her a moment later fred weasley chucked his beaters club at the back of flints head flints nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed that will do shrieked madam hooch zooming between them penalty shot to gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their chaser penalty shot to slytherin for deliberate damage to their chaser come off it miss howled fred but madam hooch blew her whistle and alicia flew forward to take the penalty come on alicia yelled lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd yes shes beaten the keeper twentyzero to gryffindor harry turned the firebolt sharply to watch flint still bleeding freely fly forward to take the slytherin penalty wood was hovering in front of the gryffindor goal posts his jaw clenched  course woods a superb keeper lee jordan told the crowd as flint waited for madam hoochs whistle superb very difficult to pass  very difficult indeed  yes i dont believe it hes saved it relieved harry zoomed away gazing around for the snitch but still making sure he caught every word of lees commentary it was essential that he hold malfoy off the snitch until gryffindor was more than fifty points up  gryffindor in possession no slytherin in possession  no  gryffindor back in possession and its katie 
bell katie bell for gryffindor with the quaffle shes streaking up the field  that was deliberate montague a slytherin chaser had swerved in front of katie and instead of seizing the quaffle had grabbed her head katie cartwheeled in the air managed to stay on her broom but dropped the quaffle madam hoochs whistle rang out again as she soared over to montague and began shouting at him a minute later katie had put another penalty past the slytherin seeker thirtyzero take that you dirty cheating jordan if you cant commentate in an unbiased way   im telling it like it is professor harry felt a huge jolt of excitement he had seen the snitch  it was shimmering at the foot of one of the gryffindor goal posts  but he mustnt catch it yet  and if malfoy saw it  faking a look of sudden concentration harry pulled his firebolt around and sped off toward the slytherin end  it worked malfoy went haring after him clearly thinking harry had seen the snitch there  whoosh one of the bludgers came streaking past harrys right ear hit by the gigantic slytherin beater derrick then again  whoosh 
the second bludger grazed harrys elbow the other beater bole was closing in harry had a fleeting glimpse of bole and derrick zooming toward him clubs raised  he turned the firebolt upward at the last second and bole and derrick collided with a sickening crunch ha haaa yelled lee jordan as the slytherin beaters lurched away from each other clutching their heads too bad boys youll need to get up earlier than that to beat a firebolt and its gryffindor in possession again as johnson takes the quaffle  flint alongside her  poke him in the eye angelina  it was a joke professor it was a joke  oh no  flint in possession flint flying toward the gryffindor goal posts come on now wood save   but flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the slytherin end and lee swore so badly that professor mcgonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him sorry professor sorry wont happen again so gryffindor in the lead thirty points to ten and gryffindor in possession   it was turning into the dirtiest game harry had ever played in enraged that gryffindor had taken such an early lead the slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the quaffle bole hit alicia with his club and tried to say hed thought she was a bludger george weasley elbowed bole in the face in retaliation madam hooch awarded both teams penalties and wood pulled off another spectacular save making the score fortyten to gryffindor 
the snitch had disappeared again malfoy was still keeping close to harry as he soared over the match looking around for it  once gryffindor was fifty points ahead  katie scored fiftyten fred and george weasley were swooping around her clubs raised in case any of the slytherins were thinking of revenge bole and derrick took advantage of freds and georges absence to aim both bludgers at wood; they caught him in the stomach one after the other and he rolled over in the air clutching his broom completely winded madam hooch was beside herself you do not attack the keeper unless the quaffle is within the scoring area she shrieked at bole and derrick gryffindor penalty and angelina scored sixtyten moments later fred weasley pelted a bludger at warrington knocking the quaffle out of his hands; alicia seized it and put it through the slytherin goal  seventyten the gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse  gryffindor was sixty points in the lead and if harry caught the snitch now the cup was theirs harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field high above the rest of the game with malfoy speeding along behind him and then he saw it the snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand but suddenly the firebolt was slowing down  
horrified he looked around malfoy had thrown himself forward grabbed hold of the firebolts tail and was pulling it back you   harry was angry enough to hit malfoy but couldnt reach  malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt but his eyes were sparkling maliciously he had achieved what hed wanted to do  the snitch had disappeared again penalty penalty to gryffindor ive never seen such tactics madam hooch screeched shooting up to where malfoy was sliding back onto his nimbus two thousand and one you cheating scum lee jordan was howling into the megaphone dancing out of professor mcgonagalls reach you filthy cheating b   professor mcgonagall didnt even bother to tell him off she was actually shaking her finger in malfoys direction her hat had fallen off and she too was shouting furiously alicia took gryffindors penalty but she was so angry she missed by several feet the gryffindor team was losing concentration and the slytherins delighted by malfoys foul on harry were being spurred on to greater heights slytherin in possession slytherin heading for goal  montague scores   lee groaned seventytwenty to gryffindor  harry was now marking malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other harry wasnt going to let malfoy anywhere near the snitch  
get out of it potter malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found harry blocking him angelina johnson gets the quaffle for gryffindor come on angelina come on harry looked around every single slytherin player apart from malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward angelina including the slytherin keeper  they were all going to block her  harry wheeled the firebolt around bent so low he was lying flat along the handle and kicked it forward like a bullet he shot toward the slytherins aaaaaaarrrgh   they scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them; angelinas way was clear she scores she scores gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty harry who had almost pelted headlong into the stands skidded to a halt in midair reversed and zoomed back into the middle of the field and then he saw something to make his heart stand still malfoy was diving a look of triumph on his face  there a few feet above the grass below was a tiny golden glimmer  harry urged the firebolt downward but malfoy was miles ahead  go go go harry urged his broom he was gaining on malfoy  harry flattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him  he was at malfoys ankles  he was level  
harry threw himself forward took both hands off his broom he knocked malfoys arm out of the way and yes he pulled out of his dive his hand in the air and the stadium exploded harry soared above the crowd an odd ringing in his ears the tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers then wood was speeding toward him halfblinded by tears; he seized harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder harry felt two large thumps as fred and george hit them; then angelinas alicias and katies voices weve won the cup weve won the cup tangled together in a manyarmed hug the gryffindor team sank yelling hoarsely back to earth wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field hands were raining down on their backs harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him then he and the rest of the team were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd thrust into the light he saw hagrid plastered with crimson rosettes  yeh beat em harry yeh beat em wait till i tell buckbeak there was percy jumping up and down like a maniac all dignity forgotten professor mcgonagall was sobbing harder even than wood wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag; and there fighting their way toward harry were ron and hermione words failed them they simply beamed as harry was borne toward the stands where dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous quidditch cup 
if only there had been a dementor around  as a sobbing wood passed harry the cup as he lifted it into the air harry felt he could have produced the worlds best patronus 
professor trelawneys prediction harrys euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake but they couldnt exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castle trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their owls ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his newts nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy 
hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermione harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they couldnt restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column read monday 9 oclock arithmancy 9 oclock transfiguration lunch 1 oclock charms 1 oclock ancient runes hermione? ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er  are you sure youve copied down these times right? what? snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining it yes of course i have is there any point asking how youre going to sit for two exams at once? said harry no said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramatica? 
oh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table looking for the book just then there was a rustle at the window and hedwig fluttered through it a note clutched tight in her beak its from hagrid said harry ripping the note open buckbeaks appeal  its set for the sixth thats the day we finish our exams said hermione still looking everywhere for her arithmancy book and theyre coming up here to do it said harry still reading from the letter someone from the ministry of magic and  and an executioner hermione looked up startled theyre bringing the executioner to the appeal but that sounds as though theyve already decided yeah it does said harry slowly they cant ron howled ive spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they cant just ignore it all but harry had a horrible feeling that the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures had had its mind made up for it by mr malfoy draco who had been noticeably subdued since gryffindors triumph in the quidditch final seemed to regain some of his old swagger over the next few days from sneering comments harry overheard malfoy was certain buckbeak was going to be killed and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about it was all harry could do to stop himself imitating hermione and hitting malfoy in the face on these occasions and the worst thing of all was that they 
had no time or opportunity to go and see hagrid because the strict new security measures had not been lifted and harry didnt dare retrieve his invisibility cloak from below the oneeyed witch k k k exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle the third years emerged from transfiguration at lunchtime on monday limp and ashenfaced comparing results and bemoaning the difficulty of the tasks they had been set which had included turning a teapot into a tortoise hermione irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise had looked more like a turtle which was the least of everyone elses worries mine still had a spout for a tail what a nightmare were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam? it still had a willowpatterned shell dyou think that 11 count against me? then after a hasty lunch it was straight back upstairs for the charms exam hermione had been right; professor flitwick did indeed test them on cheering charms harry slightly overdid his out of nerves and ron who was partnering him ended up in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself after dinner the students hurried back to their common rooms not to relax but to start studying for care of magical creatures potions and astronomy 
hagrid presided over the care of magical creatures exam the following morning with a very preoccupied air indeed; his heart didnt seem to be in it at all he had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the class and told them that to pass the test their flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour as flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices it was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken and also gave harry ron and hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid beakys gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that harrys flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but still  well know day after tomorrow  one way or the other   they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he couldnt get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away then came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower; history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval witchhunts while wishing he could have had one of fortescue s choco nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a bakinghot sun; then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over their second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had 
ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow cross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart excellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk grinning full marks flushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermione ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking waisthigh into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming hermione said lupin startled whats the matter? p  p  professor mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk sh  she said id failed everything it took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castle ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at hermione s boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps cornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harry hello there harry he said just had an exam i expect? nearly finished? 
yes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the background lovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lake pity  pity  he sighed deeply and looked down at harry im here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step in does that mean the appeals already happened? ron interrupted stepping forward no no its scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ron then you might not have to witness an execution at all said ron stoutly the hippogriff might get off before fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping with a thin black mustache harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because the very old wizard squinted toward hagrids cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear im getting too old for this  two oclock isnt it fudge? the blackmustached man was fingering something in his belt; harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but 
hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall whyd you stop me? said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them? theyve even got the axe ready this isnt justice ron your dad works for the ministry you cant go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argues his case properly they cant possibly execute buckbeak  but harry could tell hermione didnt really believe what she was saying all around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harry ron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak didnt join in harrys and rons last exam was divination; hermiones muggle studies they walked up the marble staircase together; hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor trelawneys classroom trying to cram in a bit of lastminute studying shes seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball? he asked them unhappily nope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch; harry knew that he was counting down the time until buckbeaks appeal started 
the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask? was it okay? but they all refused to say she says the crystal balls told her that if i tell you ill have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landing thats convenient snorted ron you know im starting to think hermione was right about her  he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead  shes a right old fraud yeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two oclock wish shed hurry up  parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride she says ive got all the makings of a true seer she informed harry and ron i saw loads of stuff  well good luck she hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender ronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their heads ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagrid 
finally after about twenty minutes rons large feet reappeared on the ladder howd it go? harry asked him standing up rubbish said ron couldnt see a thing so i made some stuff up dont think she was convinced though  meet you in the common room harry muttered as professor trelawneys voice called harry potter the tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed the fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball good day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orb  take your time now  then tell me what you see within it  harry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he could willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happened well? professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you see? the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretend er   said harry a dark shape  um  what does it resemble? whispered professor trelawney think now  
harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak a hippogriff he said firmly indeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor hagrids trouble with the ministry of magic look closer    does the hippogriff appear to    have its head? yes said harry firmly are you sure? professor trelawney urged him are you quite sure dear? you dont see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it? no said harry starting to feel slightly sick no blood? no weeping hagrid? no said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine its  flying away  professor trelawney sighed well dear i think well leave it there  a little disappointing  but im sure you did your best relieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind him it will happen tonight 
harry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging s  sorry? said harry but professor trelawney didnt seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing  and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her own the dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followers his servant has been chained these twelve years tonight before midnight  the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonight  before midnight    the servant    will set out  to rejoin  his master  professor trelawneys head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor trelawneys head snapped up again im so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you know  i drifted off for a moment  harry sat there staring at her is there anything wrong my dear? you  you just told me that the  the dark lords going to rise again  that his servants going to go back to him  professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled 
the dark lord? hewhomustnotbenamed? my dear boy thats hardly something to joke about  rise again indeed   but you just said it you said the dark lord   i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as farfetched as that harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase wondering  had he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction? or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test? five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor trelawneys words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of longawaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the corner however sat ron and hermione professor trelawney harry panted just told me   but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces buckbeak lost said ron weakly hagrids just sent this hagrids note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible lost appeal theyre going to execute at sunset nothing you can do dont come down 
i dont want you to see it hagrid weve got to go said harry at once he cant just sit there on his own waiting for the executioner sunset though said ron who was staring out the window in a glazed sort of way wed never be allowed  specially you harry  harry sank his head into his hands thinking if we only had the invisibility cloak  where is it? said hermione harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the oneeyed witch  if snape sees me anywhere near there again im in serious trouble he finished thats true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees you  how do you open the witchs hump again? you  you tap it and say ‘dissendium  said harry but   hermione didnt wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the room pushed open the fat ladys portrait and vanished from sight she hasnt gone to get it? ron said staring after her 
she had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes hermione i dont know whats gotten into you lately said ron astounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney   hermione looked rather flattered they went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the door okay she whispered no one there  cloak on   walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the trees they reached hagrids cabin and knocked he was a minute in answering and when he did he looked all around for his visitor palefaced and trembling its us harry hissed were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off yeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak 
hagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tears wan some tea? he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle wheres buckbeak hagrid? said hermione hesitantly i  i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug hes tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an  an smell fresh air  before   hagrid s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor ill do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess theres another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelessly isnt there anything anyone can do hagrid? harry asked fiercely sitting down next to him dumbledore hes tried said hagrid hes got no power ter overrule the committee he told em buckbeaks all right but theyre scared  yeh know what lucius malfoys like  threatened em i expect  an the executioner macnair hes an old pal o malfoys  but itll be quick an clean  an ill be beside him  
hagrid swallowed his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort dumbledore s gonna come down while it  while it happens wrote me this mornin said he wants ter  ter be with me great man dumbledore  hermione who had been rummaging in hagrid s cupboard for another milk jug let out a small quickly stifled sob she straightened up with the new jug in her hands fighting back tears well stay with you too hagrid she began but hagrid shook his shaggy head yehre ter go back up ter the castle i told yeh i don wan yeh watchin an yeh shouldn be down here anyway  if fudge an dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry yehll be in big trouble silent tears were now streaming down hermione s face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriek ron i  i dont believe it  its scabbersl ron gaped at her what are you talking about? hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back inside scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table scabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing here? 
he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabbers looked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in rons hands as though desperate to free himself its okay scabbers said ron no cats theres nothing here to hurt you hagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment theyre cornin  harry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudge behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner macnair yeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh here  go now  ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak ill let yeh out the back way said hagrid they followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind hagrids pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously 
its okay beaky said hagrid softly its okay  he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goin but they didnt move hagrid we cant   well tell them what really happened   they cant kill him   go said hagrid fiercely its bad enough without you lot in trouble an all they had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight go quick he said hoarsely don listen  and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door slowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around hagrids house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snap please lets hurry hermione whispered i cant stand it i cant bear it  they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear purpletinged grey but to the west there was a rubyred glow ron stopped dead 
oh please ron hermione began its scabbers  he wont  stay put   ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into rons hand scabbers its me you idiot its ron ron hissed they heard a door open behind them and mens voices oh ron please lets move theyre going to do it hermione breathed okay  scabbers stay put   they walked forward; harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped again i cant hold him  scabbers shut up everyonell hear us   the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from hagrids garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe hermione swayed on the spot they did it she whispered to harry i d  dont believe it  they did it 
cat rat and dog harrys mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the longshadowed grounds then behind them they heard a wild howling hagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his arms we cant said ron who was paperwhite hell be in worse trouble if they know weve been to see him hermione s breathing was shallow and uneven how  could  they? she choked how could they? come on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chattering 
they set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast now by the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around them scabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chest the rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket whats the matter with you you stupid rat? stay still  ouch he bit me ron be quiet hermione whispered urgently fudgell be out here in a minute   he wont  stay  put   scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his might trying to break free of rons grip whats the matter with him? but harry had just seen  slinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness  crookshanks whether he could see them or was following the sound of scabberss squeaks harry couldnt tell crookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go away but the cat was getting nearer  scabbers  no too late  the rat had slipped between rons clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after him and before harry or hermione could stop him ron 
had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness ron hermione moaned she and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks get away from him  get away  scabbers come here   there was a loud thud gotchal get off you stinking cat   harry and hermione almost fell over ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump ron  come on  back under the cloak   hermione panted dumbledore  the minister  theyll be coming back out in a minute   but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws  something was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow  an enormous paleeyed jetblack dog harry reached for his wand but too late  the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath saw inchlong teeth  
but the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him dazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack ron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside; the dogs jaws fastened instead around rons outstretched arm harry lunged forward he seized a handful of the brutes hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll  then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall too harry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes  lumos he whispered the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer and there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots  ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight  ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again all they could see now was one of rons legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground  but a 
horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; rons leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sight harry  weve got to go for help   hermione gasped; she was bleeding too; the willow had cut her across the shoulder no that things big enough to eat him; we havent got time   harry  were never going to get through without help   another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knuckles if that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and there trying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he couldnt get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the trees blows oh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing uncertainly on the spot please  crookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk abruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shook crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped harrys arm painfully hard how did he know  ? 
hes friends with that dog said harry grimly ive seen them together come on  and keep your wand out   they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next; he crawled forward headfirst and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel crookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from harrys wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside him wheres ron? she whispered in a terrified voice this way said harry setting off bentbacked after crookshanks where does this tunnel come out? hermione asked breathlessly from behind him i dont know  its marked on the marauders map but fred and george said no ones ever gotten into it it goes off the edge of the map but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade  they moved as fast as they could bent almost double; ahead of them crookshanks s tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes  all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him  he was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouch  and then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone instead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening 
he and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyond it was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded up harry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but nodded harry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed harrys arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows harry she whispered i think were in the shrieking shack harry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely ghosts didnt do that he said slowly at that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling hermione s grip on harrys arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers he raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go quietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs 
they reached the dark landing nox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it; a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nod wand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide open on a magnificent fourposter bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks purring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ron harry and hermione dashed across to him ron  are you okay? wheres the dog? not a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry its a trap   what   hes the dog  hes an animagus  ron was staring over harrys shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind them a mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes hadnt been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius black 
 expelliarmusv he croaked pointing rons wand at them harrys and hermiones wands shot out of their hands high in the air and black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harry i thought youd come and help your friend he said hoarsely his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher im grateful  it will make everything much easier  the taunt about his father rang in harrys ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in harrys chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attack  to kill without knowing what he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back  no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; ron however spoke to black if you want to kill harry youll have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spoke something flickered in blacks shadowed eyes lie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even more did you hear me? ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright youll have to kill all three of us 
therell be only one murder here tonight said black and his grin widened whys that? harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione didnt care last time did you? didnt mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at pettigrew  whats the matter gone soft in azkaban? harry hermione whimpered be quiet he killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of hermione s and rons restraint and lunged forward  he had forgotten about magic  he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen whereas black was a tall fullgrown man  all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he didnt care how much he got hurt in return  perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black didnt raise the wands in time  one of harrys hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of harrys other hand collided with the side of blacks head and they fell backward into the wall  hermione was screaming; ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in blacks hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed harrys face by inches; harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could find but blacks free hand had found harrys throat  no he hissed ive waited too long   
the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askew then he saw hermione s foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain; ron had thrown himself on blacks wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter  he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but  argh crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into harrys arm; harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward harrys wand  no you dont roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting; harry snatched up his wand and turned  get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione they didnt need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and rons wands ron crawled to the four poster and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken leg black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at blacks heart going to kill me harry? he whispered 
harry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at blacks chest looking down at him a livid bruise was rising around blacks left eye and his nose was bleeding you killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steady black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes i dont deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole story the whole story? harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort thats all i need to know youve got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now youll regret it if you dont  you dont understand  i understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you? my mum  trying to stop voldemort killing me  and you did that  you did it  before either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry; crookshanks leapt onto blacks chest and settled himself there right over blacks heart black blinked and looked down at the cat get off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off him but crookshanks sank his claws into blacks robes and wouldnt shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sob 
harry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too? it was in league with black  if it was prepared to die trying to protect black that wasnt harrys business  if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for harrys parents  harry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chance  the seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poised black staring up at him crookshanks on his chest rons ragged breathing came from near the bed; hermione was quite silent and then came a new sound  muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor  someone was moving downstairs were up here hermione screamed suddenly were up here  sirius black  quick black made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks; harry gripped his wand convulsively  do it noua said a voice in his head  but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still hadnt done it the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harry standing there with his wand covering 
black and then to black himself crumpled and bleeding at harrys feet  expelliarmusv lupin shouted harrys wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest harry stood there feeling suddenly empty he hadnt done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementors then lupin spoke in a very tense voice where is he sirius? harry looked quickly at lupin he didnt understand what lupin meant who was lupin talking about? he turned to look at black again blacks face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he didnt move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewildered but then   lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind  why hasnt he shown himself before now? unless  lupins eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see   unless he was the one  unless you switched    without telling me? very slowly his sunken gaze never leaving lupins face black nodded 
professor harry interrupted loudly whats going on  ? but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixedly at black the professor walked to blacks side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brother harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach i dont believe it hermione screamed lupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin wildeyed you  you   hermione     you and him hermione calm down   i didnt tell anyone hermione shrieked ive been covering up for you   hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain   harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of fury i trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time youve been his friend 
youre wrong said lupin i havent been siriuss friend but i am now  let me explain  no hermione screamed harry dont trust him hes been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too  hes a werewolf there was a ringing silence everyones eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather pale not at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three im afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly dont want harry dead  an odd shiver passed over his face but i wont deny that i am a werewolf ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away from me werewolf lupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you known? ages hermione whispered since i did professor snapes essay  hell be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant  did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon? or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me? both hermione said quietly 
lupin forced a laugh youre the cleverest witch of your age ive ever met hermione im not hermione whispered if id been a bit cleverer id have told everyone what you are but they already know said lupin at least the staff do dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf? ron gasped is he mad? some of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that im trustworthy   and he was wrong harry yelled you ve been helping him all the time he was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the fourposter bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his leg i have not been helping sirius said lupin if youll give me a chance ill explain look   he separated harrys rons and hermiones wands and threw each back to its owner; harry caught his stunned there said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt youre armed were not now will you listen? harry didnt know what to think was it a trick? 
if you havent been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was here? the map said lupin the marauders map i was in my office examining it   you know how to work it? harry said suspiciously of course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it im moony  that was my friends nickname for me at school you wrote  ? the important thing is i was watching it carefully this evening because i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed and i was right wasnt i? he had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feet you might have been wearing your fathers old cloak harry   how dyou know about the cloak? the number of times i saw james disappearing under it  said lupin waving an impatient hand again the point is even if youre wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the marauders map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hagrids hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody else what? said harry no we werent 
i couldnt believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring harrys interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you? no one was with us said harry and then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius black  i saw him collide with you; i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow   one of us ron said angrily no ron said lupin two of you he had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over ron do you think i could have a look at the rat? he said evenly what? said ron whats scabbers got to do with it? everything said lupin could i see him please? ron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emerged thrashing desperately; ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on blacks leg and made a soft hissing noise lupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabbers what? ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scared whats my rat got to do with anything? thats not a rat croaked sirius black suddenly 
what dyou mean  of course hes a rat   no hes not said lupin quietly hes a wizard an animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrew 
moony wormtail padfoot and prongs it took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in then ron voiced what harry was thinking youre both mental ridiculous said hermione faintly peter pettigrews dead said harry he killed him twelve years ago he pointed at black whose face twitched convulsively i meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of me  not this time though and crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers; ron yelled with pain as blacks weight fell on his broken leg 
sirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you cant do it just like that  they need to understand  weve got to explain   we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin off one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching rons face and neck as he tried to escape theyve  got  a  right  to  know  everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black rons kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i dont understand and harry  you owe harry the truth sirius black stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under rons bitten scratched and bleeding hands all right then black said without taking his eyes off the rat tell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned for  youre nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support ive had enough of this im off he tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbers youre going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listen hes not peter hes scabbers ron yelled trying to force the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting too hard; ron swayed and 
overbalanced and harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed then ignoring black harry turned to lupin there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of them  they didnt see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in rons hands everyone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself  until i saw the map tonight because the marauders map never lies  peters alive rons holding him harry harry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silently black and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew? azkaban must have unhinged black after all  but why was lupin playing along with him? then hermione spoke in a trembling wouldbe calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly but professor lupin  scabbers cant be pettigrew  it just cant be true you know it cant  why cant it be true? lupin said calmly as though they were in class and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows because    because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework  the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become 
animals; theres a register showing what animal they become and their markings and things  and i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and pettigrews name wasnt on the list   harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laugh right again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts if youre going to tell them the story get a move on remus snarled black who was still watching scabberss every desperate move ive waited twelve years im not going to wait much longer all right  but youll need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it began  lupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing no one there  this place is haunted said ron its not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never haunted  the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said thats where all of this starts  with my becoming a werewolf none of this 
could have happened if i hadnt been bitten  and if i hadnt been so foolhardy  he looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione said shh she was watching lupin very intently i was a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i transform  i am able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane again before the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents werent likely to want their children exposed to me but then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i shouldnt come to school  lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house  lupin looked miserably around the room  the tunnel that leads to it  they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transform the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerous harry couldnt see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound 
apart from lupins voice was scabberss frightened squeaking my transformations in those days were  were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumor    even now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dont dare approach it  but apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friends sirius black  peter pettigrew  and of course your father harry  james potter now my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see her  i was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course they like you hermione worked out the truth  and they didnt desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best times of my life they became animagi my dad too? said harry astounded yes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong  one reason 
the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at will but how did that help you? said hermione sounding puzzled they couldnt keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under jamess invisibility cloak they transformed    peter as the smallest could slip beneath the willows attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them hurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face im getting there sirius im getting there  well highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animals they were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did  and thats how we came to write the marauders map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongs 
what sort of animal  ? harry began but hermione cut him off that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if youd given the others the slip and bitten somebody? a thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless  carried away with our own cleverness i sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledores trust of course  he had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next months adventure and i havent changed  lupins face had hardened and there was selfdisgust in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i didnt do it why? because i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that id betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that id led others along with me  and dumbledores trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with it    so in a way snapes been right about me all along 
snape? said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin whats snape got to do with it? hes here sirius said lupin heavily hes teaching here as well he looked up at harry ron and hermione professor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore all year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasons  you see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me   black made a derisive noise it served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up to    hoping he could get us expelled  severus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we  er  didnt like each other very much he especially disliked james jealous i think of jamess talent on the quidditch field    anyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be  er  amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and hed be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it  if hed got as far as this house hed have met a fully grown werewolf  but your father whod heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his life    snape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was 
forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i was  so thats why snape doesnt like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the joke? thats right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointing directly at lupin 
the servant of lord voldermort hermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though hed received a huge electric shock i found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupins chest very useful potter i thank you  snape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph youre wondering perhaps how i knew you were here? he said his eyes glittering ive just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i did  lucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sight severus   lupin began but snape overrode him 
ive told the headmaster again and again that youre helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and heres the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout severus youre making a mistake said lupin urgently you havent heard everything  i can explain  sirius is not here to kill harry   two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes this  he was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupin  a tame werewolf   you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkaban? bang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of snapes wand and twisted themselves around lupins mouth wrists and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rage black started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between blacks eyes give me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i will black stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred harry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believe he glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermione however took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor 
snape  it  it wouldnt hurt to hear what theyve got to say w  would it? miss granger you are already facing suspension from this school snape spat you potter and weasley are outofbounds in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tongue but if  if there was a mistake   keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged dont talk about what you dont understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at blacks face hermione fell silent vengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch you  the jokes on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle  he jerked his head at ron  ill come quietly  up to the castle? said snape silkily i dont think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow theyll be very pleased to see you black  pleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresay  what little color there was in blacks face left it you  youve got to hear me out he croaked the rat  look at the rat   but there was a mad glint in snape s eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reason 
come on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands ill drag the werewolf perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too   before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door get out of the way potter youre in enough trouble already snarled snape if i hadnt been here to save your skin   professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year harry said ive been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why didnt he just finish me off then? dont ask me to fathom the way a werewolfs mind works hissed snape get out of the way potter youre pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you wont even listen   silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked looking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if hed killed you youd have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black  now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potter harry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wand 
 expelliarmus he yelled  except that his wasnt the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked out harry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment snape s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanks you shouldnt have done that said black looking at harry you should have left him to me  harry avoided blacks eyes he wasnt sure even now that hed done the right thing we attacked a teacher  we attacked a teacher   hermione whimpered staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh were going to be in so much trouble   lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them thank you harry he said im still not saying i believe you he told lupin then its time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy  give me peter please now ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest come off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers ? i mean  he looked up at harry and 
hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat  there are millions of rats  hows he supposed to know which one hes after if he was locked up in azkaban? you know sirius thats a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he was? black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on rons shoulder was scabbers how did you get this? lupin asked black thunderstruck fudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page  on this boys shoulder  i knew him at once    how many times had i seen him transform? and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwarts  to where harry was  my god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front paw  what about it? said ron defiantly hes got a toe missing said black of course lupin breathed so simple  so brilliant  he cut it off himself? 
just before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that id betrayed lily and james then before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself  and sped down into the sewer with the other rats  didnt you ever hear ron? said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his finger look scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something hes been in my family for ages right  twelve years in fact said lupin didnt you ever wonder why he was living so long? we  weve been taking good care of him said ron not looking too good at the moment though is he? said lupin id guess hes been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose again  hes been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bed but that wasnt right harry thought suddenly  scabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks    ever since rons return from egypt    since the time when black had escaped  this cat isnt mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshanks s fluffy head hes the most intelligent of his kind ive ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted me  finally i managed to 
communicate to him what i was after and hes been helping me  what do you mean? breathed hermione he tried to bring peter to me but couldnt  so he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for me  as i understand it he took them from a boys bedside table  harrys brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurd    and yet    but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it  croaked black this cat  crookshanks did you call him?  told me peter had left blood on the sheets  i supposed he bit himself  well faking his own death had worked once  these words jolted harry to his senses and why did he fake his death? he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents no said lupin harry   and now youve come to finish him off yes i have said black with an evil look at scabbers then i shouldve let snape take you harry shouted harry said lupin hurriedly dont you see? all this time weve thought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down  but it was the other way around dont you see? peter betrayed your mother and father  sirius tracked peter down   
thats not true harry yelled he was their secretkeeper he said so before you turned up he said he killed them he was pointing at black who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright harry  i as good as killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as secret keeper instead of me  im to blame i know it  the night they died id arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safe but when i arrived at his hiding place hed gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it didnt feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodies  i realized what peter mustve done  what id done  his voice broke he turned away enough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before theres one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that rat what are you going to do with him if i give him to you? ron asked lupin tensely force him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it wont hurt him ron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turning his tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius? said lupin 
black had already retrieved snapes wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face together? he said quietly i think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one  two  three a flash of bluewhite light erupted from both wands; for a moment scabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly  ron yelled  the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then  it was like watching a speededup film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up he was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like scabbers s fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again well hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no see 
s  sirius  r  remus  even pettigrews voice was squeaky again his eyes darted toward the door my friends  my old friends  blacks wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning look then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casual weve been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed   remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face you dont believe him do you ? he tried to kill me remus  so weve heard said lupin more coldly id like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if youd be so   hes come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly pointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now hes going to kill me too  youve got to help me remus  blacks face looked more skulllike than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyes no ones going to try and kill you until weve sorted a few things out said lupin sorted things out? squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew hed come after me i knew hed be back for me ive been waiting for this for twelve years 
you knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban? said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it before? hes got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there? i suppose hewhomustnotbenamed taught him a few tricks black started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole room voldemort teach me tricks? he said pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him what scared to hear your old masters name? said black i dont blame you peter his lot arent very happy with you are they? dont know what you mean sirius   muttered pettigrew his breathing faster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat now you havent been hiding from me for twelve years said black youve been hiding from voldemorts old supporters i heard things in azkaban peter  they all think youre dead or youd have to answer to them  ive heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the double crosser doublecrossed them voldemort went to the potters on your information  and voldemort met his downfall there and not all voldemorts supporters ended up in azkaban did they? there are still plenty out here biding their time pretending theyve seen the error of their ways  if they ever got wind that you were still alive peter   
dont know  what youre talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you dont believe this  this madness remus   i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenly innocent but scared squealed pettigrew if voldemorts supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban  the spy sirius black blacks face contorted how dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort? when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? but you peter  ill never understand why i didnt see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends whod look after you didnt you? it used to be us  me and remus  and james  pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath me a spy  must be out of your mind  never  dont know how you can say such a   lily and james only made you secretkeeper because i suggested it black hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plan  a bluff  voldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream theyd use a weak talentless thing like you  it must have been the finest moment of your miserable life telling voldemort you could hand him the potters 
pettigrew was muttering distractedly; harry caught words like farfetched and lunacy but he couldnt help paying more attention to the ashen color of pettigrews face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door professor lupin? said hermione timidly can  can i say something? certainly hermione said lupin courteously well  scabbers  i mean this  this man  hes been sleeping in harrys dormitory for three years if hes working for youknowwho how come he never tried to hurt harry before now? there said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed hand thank you you see remus? i have never hurt a hair of harrys head why should i? ill tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you voldemorts been in hiding for fifteen years they say hes half dead you werent about to commit murder right under albus dumbledores nose for a wreck of a wizard whod lost all of his power were you? youd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him wouldnt you? why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? keeping an ear out for news werent you peter? just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin him  pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talk er  mr black  sirius? said hermione 
black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her if you dont mind me asking how  how did you get out of azkaban if you didnt use dark magic? thank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactly precisely what i   but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answer i dont know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that wasnt a happy thought so the dementors couldnt suck it out of me  but it kept me sane and knowing who i am    helped me keep my powers  so when it all became    too much  i could transform in my cell    become a dog dementors cant see you know  he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions  they could tell that my feelings were less  less human less complex when i was a dog  but they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it didnt trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand  but then i saw peter in that picture  i realized he was at hogwarts with harry    perfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength again  pettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotized 
 ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies  and to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry whod dare say hed betrayed lord voldemort? hed be welcomed back with honors  so you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still alive  harry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs weasley the guards say hes been talking in his sleep  always the same words  ‘hes at hog warts it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors couldnt destroy it  it wasnt a happy feeling  it was an obsession    but it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a dog  its so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused  i was thin very thin    thin enough to slip through the bars  i swam as a dog back to the mainland  i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog ive been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of course you fly as well as your father did harry  he looked at harry who did not look away believe me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed them and at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he nodded no 
pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harrys nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though praying sirius  its me  its peter  your friend  you wouldnt  black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled theres enough filth on my robes without you touching them said black remus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you dont believe this  wouldnt sirius have told you theyd changed the plan? not if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume thats why you didnt tell me sirius? he said casually over pettigrews head forgive me remus said black not at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spy? of course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him together? yes i think so said lupin grimly you wouldnt  you wont  gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ron 
ron  havent i been a good friend  a good pet? you wont let them kill me ron will you  youre on my side arent you? but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion i let you sleep in my bed he said kind boy  kind master  pettigrew crawled toward ron you wont let them do it  i was your rat  i was a good pet  if you made a better rat than a human its not much to boast about peter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of pettigrews reach pettigrew turned on his knees staggered forward and seized the hem of hermiones robes sweet girl  clever girl  you  you wont let them  help me  hermione pulled her robes out of pettigrews clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrified pettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably and turned his head slowly toward harry harry  harry  you look just like your father  just like him  how dare you speak to harry? roared black how dare you face him? how dare you talk about james in front of him? harry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretched harry james wouldnt have 
wanted me killed  james would have understood harry  he would have shown me mercy  both black and lupin strode forward seized pettigrews shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terror staring up at them you sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking too do you deny it? pettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversized balding baby cowering on the floor sirius sirius what could i have done? the dark lord    you have no idea  he has weapons you cant imagine  i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to happen  hewhomustnotbenamed forced me  dont lie bellowed black youd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spy he  he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew wh  what was there to be gained by refusing him? what was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed? said black with a terribly fury in his face only innocent lives peter you dont understand whined pettigrew he would have killed me sirius then you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for you 
black and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raised you should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort didnt kill you we would goodbye peter hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall no harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front of pettigrew facing the wands you cant kill him he said breathlessly you cant black and lupin both looked staggered harry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too without turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family i know harry panted well take him up to the castle well hand him over to the dementors  he can go to azkaban  but dont kill him harry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around harrys knees you  thank you  its more than i deserve  thank you   get off me harry spat throwing pettigrews hands off him in disgust im not doing this for you im doing it because  i dont reckon my dad wouldve wanted them to become killers  just for you no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wands 
youre the only person who has the right to decide harry said black but think  think what he did he can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that place he does  pettigrew was still wheezing behind him very well said lupin stand aside harry harry hesitated im going to tie him up said lupin thats all i swear harry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from lupins wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gagged but if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harry? harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see him right said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i cant mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think its best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing he hurried over to ron bent down tapped rons leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up rons leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet; ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didnt wince thats better he said thanks 
what about professor snape? said hermione in a small voice looking down at snapes prone figure theres nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little  overenthusiastic still out cold er  perhaps it will be best if we dont revive him until were safely back in the castle we can take him like this  he muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to snapes wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing position head still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a few inches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket and two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sure ill do it said lupin and me said ron savagely limping forward black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to lupins right right arm to rons left rons face was set he seemed to have taken scabberss true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high 
the dementors kiss harry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs; lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a sixlegged race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the rear getting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it; lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent this 
you know what this means? black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel turning pettigrew in? youre free said harry yes   said black but im also  i dont know if anyone ever told you  im your godfather yeah i knew that said harry well  your parents appointed me your guardian said black stiffly if anything happened to them  harry waited did black mean what he thought he meant? ill understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but  well  think about it once my names cleared  if you wanted a  a different home  some sort of explosion took place in the pit of harrys stomach what  live with you? he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleys? of course i thought you wouldnt want to said black quickly i understand i just thought id   are you insane? said harry his voice easily as croaky as blacks of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house? when can i move in? 
black turned right around to look at him; snapes head was scraping the ceiling but black didnt seem to care you want to? he said you mean it? yeah i mean it said harry blacks gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at harrys parents wedding they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches black saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were out the grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering harrys mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend  he felt dazed  what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict theyd seen on television  one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at pettigrews chest 
silently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then  a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlight snape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptly black froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop harry could see lupins silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shake oh my   hermione gasped he didnt take his potion tonight hes not safe run black whispered run now but harry couldnt run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back leave it to me  run there was a terrible snarling noise lupins head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws crookshankss hair was on end again; he was backing away  as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from harrys side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it 
backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each other  harry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was hermiones scream that alerted him  pettigrew had dived for lupins dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light  and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang  crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap  expelliarmusv harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew; lupins wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forward too late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on rons outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass there was a howl and a rumbling growl; harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest  sirius hes gone pettigrew transformed harry yelled black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at harrys words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds harry and hermione dashed over to ron 
what did he do to him? hermione whispered rons eyes were only halfclosed his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he didnt seem to recognize them i dont know  harry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone    they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midair wed better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harry pushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come   but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in pain  sirius harry muttered staring into the darkness he had a moments indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble  harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean  the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why  sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fours his hands over his head ivooo he moaned noooo  please  and then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the 
lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them  hermione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wand blinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it  im going to live with my godfather im leaving the dursleys he forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chant expecto patronum expecto patronum black gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the ground pale as death hell be all right im going to go and live with him expecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronum expecto   hermione whispered expecto  expecto but she couldnt do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closer expecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronum a thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him at the same moment harry felt 
hermione collapse next to him he was alone  completely alone  expecto  expecto patronum   harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember  sirius was innocent  innocent  well be okay  im going to live with him   expecto patronum j he gasped by the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor halt very close to him it couldnt walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside no  no   harry gasped hes innocent  expecto  expecto patronum   he could feel them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands  and lowered its hood where there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth  a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he couldnt move or speak his patronus flickered and died white fog was blinding him he had to fight  expecto patronum  he couldnt see  and in the distance he heard the familiar screaming    expecto patronum    
he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm  they werent going to take him  but a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around harrys neck they were forcing his face upward  he could feel its breath  it was going to get rid of him first  he could feel its putrid breath    his mother was screaming in his ears  she was going to be the last thing he ever heard  and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter  he felt himself fall forward onto the grass  facedown too weak to move sick and shaking harry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around him  the screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing away    something was driving the dementors back  it was circling around him and black and hermione  they were leaving  the air was warm again  with every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake  eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was  it was as bright as a unicorn  fighting to stay conscious harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it back    raising his hand to pat it    someone who looked strangely familiar  but it couldnt be  harry didnt understand he couldnt think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he fainted 
hermiones secret shocking business  shocking  miracle none of them died    never heard the like  by thunder it was lucky you were there snape  thank you minister order of merlin second class id say first class if i can wangle it thank you very much indeed minister nasty cut youve got there  blacks work i suppose? as a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger minister  ivo black had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was 
innocent they werent responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape  they obviously thought they were going to catch black singlehanded theyve got away with a great deal before now  im afraid its given them a rather high opinion of themselves  and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster  ah well snape  harry potter you know  weve all got a bit of a blind spot where hes concerned and yet  is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? personally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended  at the very least  for leading his friends into such danger consider minister  against all school rules  after all the precautions put in place for his protection  outofbounds at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer  and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too   well well  we shall see snape we shall see  the boy has undoubtedly been foolish  harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand  his limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift  he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed forever  what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors  youve really no idea what made them retreat snape? 
no minister  by the time i had come round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances extraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged black naturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castle there was a pause harrys brain seemed to be moving a little faster and as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach  he opened his eyes everything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bed harry squinted rons red hair was visible beneath madam pomfreys arm harry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open too she looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajar and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outside madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harrys bed he turned to look at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulder 
ah youre awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on harrys bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer hows ron? said harry and hermione together hell live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two  youll be staying here until im satisfied youre  potter what do you think youre doing? harry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wand i need to see the headmaster he said potter said madam pomfrey soothingly its all right theyve got black hes locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now   what? harry jumped up out of bed; hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the ward harry harry whats this? said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed  has he had any chocolate? he asked madam pomfrey anxiously minister listen harry said sirius blacks innocent peter pettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you cant let the dementors do that thing to sirius hes   but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face 
harry harry youre very confused youve been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now weve got everything under control  you havent harry yelled you ve got the wrong man minister listen please hermione said; she had hurried to harrys side and was gazing imploringly into fudges face i saw him too it was rons rat hes an animagus pettigrew i mean and   you see minister? said snape confunded both of them  blacks done a very good job on them  were not confunded harry roared minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressed im not distressed im trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if theyd just listen but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth; he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed now please minister these children need care please leave   the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again professor dumbledore sirius black   
for heavens sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not? headmaster i must insist   my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black   i suppose hes told you the same fairy tale hes planted in potters mind? spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive   that indeed is blacks story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his halfmoon spectacles and does my evidence count for nothing? snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the grounds that was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you didnt arrive in time to hear   miss granger hold your tongue now snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances   i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy  please leave us headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest   this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insist 
madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat the dementors should have arrived by now he said ill go and meet them dumbledore 111 see you upstairs he crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape hadnt moved you surely dont believe a word of blacks story? snape whispered his eyes fixed on dumbledore s face i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeated snape took a step toward dumbledore sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you havent forgotten that headmaster? you havent forgotten that he once tried to kill me? my memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietly snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same time professor blacks telling the truth  we saw pettigrew     he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf   
  hes a rat     pettigrews front paw i mean finger he cut it off   pettigrew attacked ron it wasnt sirius   but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations it is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support blacks story except your word  and the word of two thirteenyearold wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters secret keeper professor lupin can tell you   harry said unable to stop himself professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little  and the fact that he and sirius are old friends   but    listen to me harry it is too late you understand me? you must see that professor snapes version of events is far more convincing than yours he hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him   
sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady  entering gryffindor tower with a knife  without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning siriuss sentence but you believe us yes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magic  harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no    their last hope was gone what we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more time but   hermione began and then her eyes became very round oh now pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor flitwicks office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law  you know what is at stake  you  must  not  be  seen harry didnt have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door 
i am going to lock you in it is   he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck good luck? harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns? whats he talking about? what are we supposed to do? but hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chain harry come here she said urgently quick harry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from it here   she had thrown the chain around his neck too ready? she said breathlessly what are we doing? harry said completely lost hermione turned the hourglass over three times the dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but couldnt hear his own voice  and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again  he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was 
falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck hermione what  ? in here hermione seized harrys arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind them what  how  hermione what happened? weve gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off harrys neck in the darkness three hours back  harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lot which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream but   shh listen someones coming i think  i think it might be us hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door footsteps across the hall  yes i think its us going down to hagrids are you telling me harry whispered that were here in this cupboard and were out there too? yes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door im sure its us it doesnt sound like more than three people  and were walking slowly because were under the invisibility cloak   
she broke off still listening intently weve gone down the front steps  hermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxious but harry wanted a few questions answered where did you get that hourglass thing? its called a timeturner hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back ive been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i wouldnt tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry of magic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that id never ever use it for anything except my studies  ive been turning it back so i could do hours over again thats how ive been doing several lessons at once see? but  harry i dont understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours? hows that going to help sirius? harry stared at her shadowy face there must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened? we were walking down to hagrids three hours ago  this is three hours ago and we are walking down to hagrids said hermione we just heard ourselves leaving  harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration 
dumbledore just said  just said we could save more than one innocent life  and then it hit him hermione were going to save buckbeak but  how will that help sirius? dumbledore said  he just told us where the window is  the window of flitwicks office where theyve got sirius locked up weve got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak  they can escape together from what harry could see of hermiones face she looked terrified if we manage that without being seen itll be a miracle well weve got to try havent we? said harry he stood up and pressed his ear against the door doesnt sound like anyones there  come on lets go  harry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold if anyones looking out of the window   hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind them well run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forest all right? well have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout   
okay but well go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of hagrids front door or well see us we must be nearly at hagrids by now still working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses paused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they could skirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forest  safe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around; seconds later hermione arrived beside him panting right she gasped we need to sneak over to hagrids  keep out of sight harry  they made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of hagrids house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorway shaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voice its us were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off yeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quickly this is the weirdest thing weve ever done harry said fervently lets move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeak 
they crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff tethered to the fence around hagrids pumpkin patch now? harry whispered no said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free weve got to wait until theyve seen hes tied outside thats going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossible at that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrids cabin thats hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered im going to find scabbers in a moment  sure enough a few minutes later they heard hermione s shriek of surprise hermione said harry suddenly what if we  we just run in there and grab pettigrew   no said hermione in a terrified whisper dont you understand? were breaking one of the most important wizarding laws nobodys supposed to change time nobody you heard dumbledore if were seen   wed only be seen by ourselves and hagrid harry what do you think youd do if you saw yourself bursting into hagrids house? said hermione 
id  id think id gone mad said harry or id think there was some dark magic going on    exactly  you wouldnt understand you might even attack yourself dont you see? professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time  loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake okay said harry it was just an idea i just thought but hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors dumbledore fudge the old committee member and macnair the executioner were coming down the steps were about to come out hermione breathed and sure enough moments later hagrids back door opened and harry saw himself ron and hermione walking out of it with hagrid it was without a doubt the strangest sensation of his life standing behind the tree and watching himself in the pumpkin patch its okay beaky its okay   hagrid said to buckbeak then he turned to harry ron and hermione go on get goin hagrid we cant   well tell them what really happened   they cant kill him   go its bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
harry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and ron go quick don listen  there was a knock on hagrids front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone  but the harry and hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door where is the beast? came the cold voice of macnair out  outside hagrid croaked harry pulled his head out of sight as macnairs face appeared at hagrids window staring out at buckbeak then they heard fudge we  er  have to read you the official notice of execution hagrid ill make it quick and then you and macnair need to sign it macnair youre supposed to listen too thats procedure   macnairs face vanished from the window it was now or never wait here harry whispered to hermione ill do it as fudges voice started again harry darted out from behind his tree vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeak it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak 
hereafter called the condemned shall be executed on the sixth of june at sundown   careful not to blink harry stared up into buckbeaks fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fence  sentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the committees appointed executioner walden macnair  come on buckbeak harry murmured come on were going to help you quietly  quietly   as witnessed below hagrid you sign here  harry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feet well lets get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside hagrids cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside   no i  i wan ter be with him  i don wan him ter be alone   footsteps echoed from within the cabin buckbeak move harry hissed harry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeaks neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of hagrids back door one moment please macnair came dumbledores voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped 
harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster hermione s white face was sticking out from behind a tree harry hurry she mouthed harry could still hear dumbledores voice talking from within the cabin he gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trot they had reached the trees  quick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her tree seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldnt see hagrids garden at all stop he whispered to hermione they might hear us   hagrids back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently silence    then  where is it? said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beast? it was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just here how extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voice beaky said hagrid huskily 
there was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear hagrid s words through his sobs gone gone bless his little beak hes gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boy buckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him someone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forest   macnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot? said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will  hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandy o  o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come in  harry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once more now what? whispered harry looking around well have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until theyve gone back to the castle then we wait until its safe to fly buckbeak up to siriuss window he wont be there for another couple of hours  oh this is going to be difficult  
she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest the sun was setting now were going to have to move said harry thinking hard weve got to be able to see the whomping willow or we wont know whats going on okay said hermione getting a firmer grip on buckbeaks rope but weve got to keep out of sight harry remember  they moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willow theres ron said harry suddenly a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air get away from him  get away  scabbers come here   and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing after ron then he saw ron dive gotchcd get off you stinking cat   theres sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize ron  looks even worse from here doesnt it? said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch  look i just got walloped by the tree  and so did you  this is weird   
the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree froze that was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermione and there we go   harry muttered were in the moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudge and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle right after wed gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with us  macnair and fudge wouldve come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge wouldve told macnair to murder sirius on the spot  they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then  here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and haring toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completely they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin too disappeared into the gap in its roots if hed only grabbed the cloak said harry its just lying there  
he turned to hermione if i just dashed out now and grabbed it snaped never be able to get it and   harry we mustnt be seen how can you stand this? he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen? he hesitated im going to grab the cloak harry no hermione seized the back of harrys robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his hands see? hermione whispered see what would have happened? weve got to keep out of sight no buckbeak the hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again; harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadly barely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willow harrys fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it up 
get your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath shh snape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloak so thats it said hermione quietly were all down there  and now weve just got to wait until we come back up again  she took the end of buckbeaks rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her knees harry theres something i dont understand  why didnt the dementors get sirius? i remember them coming and then i think i passed out    there were so many of them  harry sat down too he explained what hed seen; how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to harrys a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat hermione s mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished but what was it? theres only one thing it could have been to make the dementors go said harry a real patronus a powerful one but who conjured it? 
harry didnt say anything he was thinking back to the person hed seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been    but how could it have been? didnt you see what they looked like? said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachers? no said harry he wasnt a teacher but it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away  if the patronus was shining so brightly didnt it light him up? couldnt you see  ? yeah i saw him said harry slowly but  maybe i imagined it  i wasnt thinking straight  i passed out right afterward   who did you think it was? i think   harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dad harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity harry your dads  well  dead she said quietly i know that said harry quickly you think you saw his ghost? i dont know  no  he looked solid  but then   
maybe i was seeing things said harry but  from what i could see  it looked like him  ive got photos of him  hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity i know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to look at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he wasnt really watching buckbeak he was thinking about his father and about his fathers three oldest friends  moony wormtail padfoot and prongs  had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead  was it so impossible his father had done the same? had he been seeing things across the lake? the figure had been too far away to see distinctly    yet he had felt sure for a moment before hed lost consciousness  the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waiting and then at last after over an hour    here we come hermione whispered she and harry got to their feet buckbeak raised his head they saw lupin pettigrew and ron clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots    followed by the unconscious snape drifting weirdly upward next came harry hermione and black they all began to walk toward the castle 
harrys heart was starting to beat very fast he glanced up at the sky any moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon  harry hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking weve got to stay put we mustnt be seen theres nothing we can do  so were just going to let pettigrew escape all over again  said harry quietly how do you expect to find a rat in the dark? snapped hermione theres nothing we can do we came back to help sirius; were not supposed to be doing anything else  all right the moon slid out from behind its cloud they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop then they saw movement  there goes lupin hermione whispered hes transforming   hermione said harry suddenly weve got to move we mustnt i keep telling you   not to interfere lupins going to run into the forest right at us hermione gasped quick she moaned dashing to untie buckbeak quick where are we going to go? where are we going to hide? the dementors will be coming any moment  
back to hagrids harry said its empty now  come on they ran as fast as they could buckbeak cantering along behind them they could hear the werewolf howling behind them  the cabin was in sight; harry skidded to the door wrenched it open and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him; harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door fang the boarhound barked loudly shh fang its us said hermione hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him that was really close she said to harry yeah  harry was looking out of the window it was much harder to see what was going on from here buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside hagrids house he lay down in front of the fire folded his wings contentedly and seemed ready for a good nap i think id better go outside again you know said harry slowly i cant see whats going on  we wont know when its time   hermione looked up her expression was suspicious im not going to try and interfere said harry quickly but if we dont see whats going on howre we going to know when its time to rescue sirius? well  okay then  ill wait here with buckbeak  but harry be careful  theres a werewolf out there  and the dementors   
harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin he could hear yelping in the distance that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius  he and hermione would be running to him any moment harry stared out toward the lake his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest  whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any moment  for a fraction of a second he stood irresolute in front of hagrids door you must not be seen but he didnt want to be seen he wanted to do the seeing  he had to know    and there were the dementors they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction gliding around the edges of the lake  they were moving away from where harry stood to the opposite bank  he wouldnt have to get near them  harry began to run he had no thought in his head except his father  if it was him  if it really was him  he had to know had to find out  the lake was coming nearer and nearer but there was no sign of anybody on the opposite bank he could see tiny glimmers of silver  his own attempts at a patronus  there was a bush at the very edge of the water harry threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves on the opposite bank the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished a terrified excitement shot through him  any moment now  come on he muttered staring about where are you? dad come on   
but no one came harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake one of them was lowering its hood it was time for the rescuer to appear  but no one was coming to help this time  and then it hit him  he understood he hadnt seen his father  he had seen himself  harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand expecto patronum  he yelled and out of the end of his wand burst not a shapeless cloud of mist but a blinding dazzling silver animal he screwed up his eyes trying to see what it was it looked like a horse it was galloping silently away from him across the black surface of the lake he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors  now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground and the dementors were falling back scattering retreating into the darkness  they were gone the patronus turned it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water it wasnt a horse it wasnt a unicorn either it was a stag it was shining brightly as the moon above  it was coming back to him  it stopped on the bank its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large silver eyes slowly it bowed its antlered head and harry realized    prongs he whispered but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature it vanished 
harry stood there hand still outstretched then with a great leap of his heart he heard hooves behind him  he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him dragging buckbeak behind her what did you do? she said fiercely you said you were only going to keep a lookout i just saved all our lives   said harry get behind here  behind this bush  ill explain hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again did anyone see you? yes havent you been listening? i saw me but i thought i was my dad its okay harry i cant believe it  you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors thats very very advanced magic  i knew i could do it this time said harry because id already done it  does that make sense? i dont know  harry look at snape together they peered around the bush at the other bank snape had regained consciousness he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry hermione and black onto them a fourth stretcher no doubt bearing ron was already floating at his side then wand held out in front of him he moved them away toward the castle right its nearly time said hermione tensely looking at her watch weve got about fortyfive minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the 
hospital wing weve got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes were missing they waited watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms again dyou reckon hes up there yet? said harry checking his watch he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west tower look hermione whispered whos that? someones coming back out of the castle harry stared through the darkness the man was hurrying across the grounds toward one of the entrances something shiny glinted in his belt macnair said harry the executioner hes gone to get the dementors this is it hermione   hermione put her hands on buckbeaks back and harry gave her a leg up then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her he pulled buckbeaks rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins ready? he whispered to hermione youd better hold on to me   he nudged buckbeaks sides with his heels buckbeak soared straight into the dark air harry gripped his flanks with his knees feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them hermione was 
holding harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her muttering oh no  i dont like this  oh i really dont like this   harry urged buckbeak forward they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle  harry pulled hard on the lefthand side of the rope and buckbeak turned harry was trying to count the windows flashing past  whoa he said pulling backward as hard as he could buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne hes there harry said spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window he reached out and as buckbeaks wings fell was able to tap sharply on the glass black looked up harry saw his jaw drop he leapt from his chair hurried to the window and tried to open it but it was locked stand back hermione called to him and she took out her wand still gripping the back of harrys robes with her left hand alohomoral the window sprang open how  how  ? said black weakly staring at the hippogriff 
get on  theres not much time said harry gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady youve got to get out of here  the dementors are coming  macnairs gone to get them black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it it was very lucky he was so thin in seconds he had managed to fling one leg over buckbeaks back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermione okay buckbeak up said harry shaking the rope up to the tower  come on the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again high as the top of the west tower buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and harry and hermione slid off him at once sirius youd better go quick harry panted theyll reach flitwicks office any moment theyll find out youre gone buckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp head what happened to the other boy? ron? croaked sirius hes going to be okay hes still out of it but madam pomfrey says shell be able to make him better quick  go but black was still staring down at harry how can i ever thank   go harry and hermione shouted together 
black wheeled buckbeak around facing the open sky well see each other again he said you are  truly your fathers son harry  he squeezed buckbeaks sides with his heels harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more  the hippogriff took off into the air    he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them  then a cloud drifted across the moon  they were gone 
owl post again harry hermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch weve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us  before dumbledore locks the door   okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky lets go  they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase  only hope dumbledore s not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediately? 
as soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i cant tell you how much im looking forward to informing the daily prophet that weve got him at last i daresay theyll want to interview you snape  and once young harrys back in his right mind i expect hell want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him  harry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of snapes smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hermiones hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure theyd really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircase then another along a new corridor  then they heard a cackling ahead peeves harry muttered grabbing hermiones wrist in here they tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits laughing his head off oh hes horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet hes all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius  she checked her watch three minutes harry they waited until peeves s gloating voice had faded into the distance then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again hermione  whatll happen  if we dont get back inside  before dumbledore locks the door? harry panted 
i dont want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minute they had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay  i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harry they crept along the corridor the door opened dumbledore s back appeared i am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck dumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forward dumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well? he said quietly we did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeak  dumbledore beamed at them well done i think   he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think youve gone too  get inside  ill lock you in   harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the timeturner back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office 
did i hear the headmaster leaving? am i allowed to look after my patients now? she was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waiting listening their nerves jangling  and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them  what was that? said madam pomfrey in alarm now they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the door really  theyll wake everybody up what do they think theyre doing? harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer  he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out   he didnt disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you cant apparate or disapparate inside this castle this  has  something  to  do  with  potter severus  be reasonable  harry has been locked up bam the door of the hospital wing burst open 
fudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himself out with it potter he bellowed what did you do? professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourself see here snape be reasonable said fudge this doors been locked we just saw   they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth calm down man fudge barked youre talking nonsense you dont know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it   that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their beds? of course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard them well there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once im afraid i dont see any point in troubling them further snape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to 
dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the ward fellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him id watch out for him if i were you dumbledore oh hes not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly hes just suffered a severe disappointment hes not the only one puffed fudge the daily prophets going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that hippogriffs escape to get out and ill be a laughingstock well  id better go and notify the ministry  and the dementors? said dumbledore theyll be removed from the school i trust? oh yes theyll have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed theyd attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy  completely out of control  no ill have them packed off back to azkaban tonight  perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance hagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her office there was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken up they could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking around 
what  what happened? he groaned harry? why are we in here? wheres sirius? wheres lupin? whats going on? harry and hermione looked at each other you explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolate when harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like going however so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night  a shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very blearyeyed hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his tableclothsized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them know i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he said i mean black escapin again an everythin  but guess what? what? they said pretending to look curious beaky he escaped hes free bin celebratin all night 
thats wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing yeah  cantve tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind  thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las night  what? said harry quickly blimey haven yeh heard? said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er  snape told all the slytherins this mornin  thought everyone d know by now  professor lupins a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night  hes packin now o course hes packing? said harry alarmed why? leavin isn he? said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he cant risk it happenin again harry scrambled to his feet im going to see him he said to ron and hermione but if hes resigned     doesnt sound like theres anything we can do   i dont care i still want to see him ill meet you back here lupins office door was open he had already packed most of his things the grindylows empty tank stood 
next to his battered old suitcase which was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door i saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the marauders map i just saw hagrid said harry and he said youd resigned its not true is it? im afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents why? said harry the ministry of magic dont think you were helping sirius do they? lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry no professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he  er  accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast youre not leaving just because of that said harry lupin smiled wryly this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents  they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you  that must never happen again youre the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever had said harry dont go 
lupin shook his head and didnt speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if im proud of anything ive done this year its how much youve learned  tell me about your patronus how dyou know about that? said harry distracted what else could have driven the dementors back? harry told lupin what had happened when hed finished lupin was smiling again yes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right  thats why we called him prongs lupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawers and turned to look at harry here  i brought this from the shrieking shack last night he said handing harry back the invisibility cloak and  he hesitated then held out the marauders map too i am no longer your teacher so i dont feel guilty about giving you back this as well its no use to me and i daresay you ron and hermione will find uses for it harry took the map and grinned you told me moony wormtail padfoot and prongs wouldve wanted to lure me out of school  you said theyd have thought it was funny and so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his case i have no hesitation in saying 
that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle there was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the marauders map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket it was professor dumbledore he didnt look surprised to see harry there your carriage is at the gates remus he said thank you headmaster lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank well  goodbye harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure well meet again sometime headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage  harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible goodbye then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands then with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the office harry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor he heard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still there why so miserable harry? he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last night 
it didnt make any difference said harry bitterly pettigrew got away didnt make any difference? said dumbledore quietly it made all the difference in the world harry you helped uncover the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate terrible something stirred in harrys memory greater and more terrible than ever before  professor trelawneys prediction professor dumbledore  yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very  very strange indeed? said dumbledore er  stranger than usual you mean? yes    her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said  she said voldemorts servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight  she said the servant would help him come back to power harry stared up at dumbledore and then she sort of became normal again and she couldnt remember anything shed said was it  was she making a real prediction? dumbledore looked mildly impressed do you know harry i think she might have been he said thoughtfully whod have thought it? that brings her total of real predictions up to two i should offer her a pay raise  but   harry looked at him aghast how could dumbledore take this so calmly? 
but  i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrew that makes it my fault if voldemort comes back it does not said dumbledore quietly hasnt your experience with the timeturner taught you anything harry? the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed  professor trelawney bless her is living proof of that  you did a very noble thing in saving pettigrews life but if he helps voldemort back to power   pettigrew owes his life to you you have sent voldemort a deputy who is in your debt  when one wizard saves another wizards life it creates a certain bond between them  and im much mistaken if voldemort wants his servant in the debt of harry potter i dont want a connection with pettigrew said harry he betrayed my parents this is magic at its deepest its most impenetrable harry but trust me  the time may come when you will be very glad you saved pettigrews life harry couldnt imagine when that would be dumbledore looked as though he knew what harry was thinking i knew your father very well both at hogwarts and later harry he said gently he would have saved pettigrew too i am sure of it harry looked up at him dumbledore wouldnt laugh  he could tell dumbledore    
i thought it was my dad whod conjured my patronus i mean when i saw myself across the lake i thought i was seeing him an easy mistake to make said dumbledore softly i expect you 11 tire of hearing it but you do look extraordinarily like james except for the eyes  you have your mothers eyes harry shook his head it was stupid thinking it was him he muttered i mean i knew he was dead you think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? you think that we dont recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? your father is alive in you harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him how else could you produce that particular patronus? prongs rode again last night it took a moment for harry to realize what dumbledore had said last night sirius told me all about how they became animagi said dumbledore smiling an extraordinary achievement  not least keeping it quiet from me and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr malfoy down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw you know harry in a way you did see your father last night  you found him inside yourself and dumbledore left the office leaving harry to his very confused thoughts 
nobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that sirius buckbeak and pettigrew had vanished except harry ron hermione and professor dumbledore as the end of term approached harry heard many different theories about what had really happened but none of them came close to the truth malfoy was furious about buckbeak he was convinced that hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper percy weasley meanwhile had much to say on the subject of siriuss escape if i manage to get into the ministry ill have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen  his girlfriend penelope though the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping sirius to freedom harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits he certainly wasnt the only one who was sorry to see professor lupin go the whole of harrys defense against the dark arts class was miserable about his resignation wonder what theyll give us next year? said seamus finnigan gloomily maybe a vampire suggested dean thomas hopefully it wasnt only professor lupins departure that was weighing on harrys mind he couldnt help thinking a 
lot about professor trelawneys prediction he kept wondering where pettigrew was now whether he had sought sanctuary with voldemort yet but the thing that was lowering harrys spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the dursleys for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with sirius from now on    his parents best friend  it would have been the next best thing to having his own father back and while no news of sirius was definitely good news because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding harry couldnt help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had and the fact that it was now impossible the exam results came out on the last day of term harry ron and hermione had passed every subject harry was amazed that he had got through potions he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might have stepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose snapes behavior toward harry over the past week had been quite alarming harry wouldnt have thought it possible that snapes dislike for him could increase but it certainly had a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of snapes thin mouth every time he looked at harry and he was constantly flexing his fingers as though itching to place them around harrys throat percy had got his topgrade newts; fred and george had scraped a handful of owls each gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running this meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold and that the gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot as everybody celebrated even harry managed to forget 
about the journey back to the dursleys the next day as he ate drank talked and laughed with the rest as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfast ive decided to drop muggle studies but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said ron i know sighed hermione but i cant stand another year like this one that timeturner it was driving me mad ive handed it in without muggle studies and divination ill be able to have a normal schedule again i still cant believe you didnt tell us about it said ron grumpily were supposed to be your friends i promised i wouldnt tell anyone said hermione severely she looked around at harry who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain two whole months before hed see it again oh cheer up harry said hermione sadly im okay said harry quickly just thinking about the holidays yeah ive been thinking about them too said ron harry youve got to come and stay with us ill fix it up with mum and dad then ill call you i know how to use a fellytone now   
a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next year  ron ignored her its the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry? come and stay and well go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal yeah  i bet the dursleysd be pleased to let me come  especially after what i did to aunt marge  feeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in it but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up  harry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder whats that thing outside your window? harry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the trains slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside the owl dropped its letter onto harrys seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig 
clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval crookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of harms way harry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted its from sirius what? said ron and hermione excitedly read it aloud dear harry i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i dont know whether theyre used to owl post buckbeak and i are in hiding i wont tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job i believe the dementors are still searching for me but they havent a hope of finding me here i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpse me soon a long way from hogwarts so that the security on the castle will be lifted there is something i never got around to telling you during our brief meeting it was i who sent you the firebolt  ha said hermione triumphantly see i told you it was from him yes but he hadnt jinxed it had he? said ron ouch the tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way 
crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me i used your name but told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault please consider it as thirteen birthdays worth of presents from your godfather i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you that night last year when you left your uncles house i had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north but i think the sight of me alarmed you i am enclosing something else for you which i think will make your next year at hogwarts more enjoyable if ever you need me send word your owl will find me ill write again soon sirius harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though hed swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp i sirius black harry potters godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends thatll be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at siriuss letter hang on theres a ps  i thought your friend ron might like to keep this owl as its my fault he no longer has a rat rons eyes widened the minute owl was still hooting excitedly 
keep him? he said uncertainly he looked closely at the owl for a moment; then to harrys and hermiones great surprise he held him out for crookshanks to sniff what doyou reckon? ron asked the cat definitely an owl? crookshanks purred thats good enough for me said ron happily hes mine harry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into kings cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as he ron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and threequarters harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed ill call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione goodbye then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and hedwigs cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashion whats that? he snarled staring at the envelope harry was still clutching in his hand if its another form for me to sign youve got another   its not said harry cheerfully its a letter from my godfather godfather? sputtered uncle vernon you havent got a godfather 
yes i have said harry brightly he was my mum and dads best friend hes a convicted murderer but hes broken out of wizard prison and hes on the run he likes to keep in touch with me though  keep up with my news  check if im happy  and grinning broadly at the look of horror on uncle vernons face harry set off toward the station exit hedwig rattling along in front of him for what looked like a much better summer than the last
